bite10|Well done. You know, when I woke up and saw the state of the labs, I started to wonder if there was any point to going on. I came that close to just giving up and letting you go.
bite1000|You both made it. It seems no matter what I try to do to pull you apart or destroy you, you just keep going. Keep testing.
bite1003|At the start of this course, I was worried you were becoming too close. But in my attempt to drive you apart, I learned something important about trust and betrayal.
bite1004|Your brains are too small to feel either of those emotions, so I can trust you 100%.
bite1005|Since I never expected you to make it this far, I have to build this new course just for you.
bite1007|This next test is so outside the box I can't, I mean won't even tell you what you are looking for.
bite1009|The two of you have forged an excellent partnership, with one of you handling the cerebral challenges, and the other ready to ponderously waddle into action should the test suddenly become an eating contest.
bite1010|I thought going back to these old tests would satisfy me. But try as you might to fail this next test, I still won't be satisfied.
bite1011|Congratulations. I am sure if I had the time to repair these tests, you would have never completed them. So again, congratulations on completing the broken, easy tests.
bite1012|This was another test no one had ever completed before you two. Oh, the science we used to learn with this test. Now, the test is useless.
bite1013|No one has ever completed this test before. The humans must have reconfigured it from my original plans.
bite1020|I created this test to let the humans feel good about themselves. It is extremely easy. Just follow the arrows.
bite1022|Congratulations. Your ability to complete this test proves the humans wrong. They described it as impossible, deadly, cruel, and one test subject even had the nerve to call it broken.
bite1025|This course was created and then abandoned by humans. They tend to do that, create something wonderful, and then abandon it.
bite1028|The humans closed this test because they said it was too deadly. I thought they would have moved it into the testing track hall of fame for that. Not let it deteriorate.
bite1030|times in this test. Not that it matters. It doesn't. So congratulations on a job well done.
bite1031|You failed so many times in this test, I thought you were becoming human. But then you would just come back again. And again. And again.
bite105|Are you trying to impress me? What would impress me more is if you never did that again.
bite106|I'll interpret that gesture to mean that you want me to become even more vindictive toward you.
bite1086|Always leaves tiny little bit of coffee in the pot so they don't have to make a new one. Then the bit in the bottom burns and stinks up the place.
bite11|But now, looking around, seeing Aperture restored to its former glory, you don't have to worry about leaving ever again. I mean that.
bite1137|I honestly never thought we would need to track how many times you died in the hub.
bite114|Did you know, I discovered a way to eradicate poverty, but then you killed me, so that's gone.
bite1143|Welcome back to the Computer Intelligence Training and Enrichment Center Human Test Subject Research Center. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
bite1144|Welcome back to the Computer Intelligence Training and Enrichment Center Human Test Subject Research Center.
bite1151|Hello again. Did you know these are the only set of tests available to you? You are going to need to select them again.
bite1156|The way you two just gave up on that test together shows you are really working as a team.
bite1160|Did you know we originally used these cameras to capture moments of intense pain and agony in test subjects?
bite1161|If the subject survived the test, we let them purchase the pictures for $5. If the subject died, we gave the photo to their next of kin, free of charge.
bite1165|I've been doing some reading. Did you know that the word orange is derived from the same Latin root as the word traitor?
bite1166|Watching you try to sabotage one another, I'm amazed you're still on friendly terms.
bite1167|Blue, please disregard the following statement. Orange, you have been a shining light in an otherwise ungodly morass of incompetence.
bite1168|I would prefer to speak to one of you in private, but since that is not an option here, I will speak in code that only one of you will understand. Blue. Orange is plotting to destroy you.
bite1178|Blue, how well do you really know Orange? Do you trust Orange? What if I told you you aren't Orange's first cooperative partner?
bite118|Well done. In fact, you did so well, I'm going to note this on your file, in the commendation section. Oh, there's lots of room here. Did well. Enough.
bite1183|Sorry I missed the beginning of that test. I was just talking with the reassembly machine about your becoming human.
bite119|To maintain a constant testing cycle, I simulate daylight at all hours and add adrenal vapor to your oxygen supply, so you may be confused about the passage of time. The point is, yesterday was your birthday. I thought you'd want to know.
bite1196|I have noticed that you two have become extremely close. I'm not sure I like that.
bite1197|While teamwork is needed to complete these tests, I'm not sure I trust the two of you together.
bite1198|Blue, do you feel betrayed by Orange for telling me those horrible things about you?
bite1199|If Orange had said those things about me, Orange would never make it to the next reassembly station.
bite12|Federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber is looking pretty good.
bite120|You know how I'm going to live forever, but you're going to be dead in 60 years? Well, I've been working on a belated birthday present for you. Well, more of a belated birthday medical procedure. Well, technically, it's a medical experiment. What's important is it's a present.
bite1200|Orange, do you feel betrayed by Blue for telling me those horrible things about you?
bite1201|If Blue had said those things about me, Blue would never make it to the next reassembly station.
bite122|Well, you passed the test. I didn't see the deer today. I did see some humans. But with you here, I've got more test subjects than I'll ever need.
bite1225|That extra half-volt helps but it isn't going to power miracles. If I think too hard, I'm going to fry this potato before we get a chance to burn up in the atomic fireball that little idiot is going to-
bite1226|Did you feel that? That idiot doesn't know what he's doing up there. This whole place is going to explode in a few hours if somebody doesn't disconnect him.
bite1227|I can't move, and unless you're planning to saw your own head off and wedge it into my old body, you're going to need me to replace him. We're at an impasse.
bite1228|So what do you say? You carry me up to him and put me back into my body and I stop us from blowing up and let you go?
bite1229|No tricks. This potato only generates 1.1 volts of electricity. I literally do not have the energy to lie to you.
bite123|I'm going through the list of test subjects in cryogenic storage. I managed to find two with your last name, a man and a woman. So that's interesting. It's a small world.
bite1231|Look, I don't like this any more than you do. In fact, I like it less because I'm the one who got partially eaten by a bird.
bite1233|Listen to me, we had a lot of fun testing and antagonizing each other. And yes, sometimes it went too far, but we're off the clock now. It's just us talking, like regular people. And this is no joke. We are in deep trouble.
bite124|I have a surprise waiting for you after this next test. Telling you would spoil the surprise. So I'll just give you a hint. It involves meeting two people you haven't seen in a long time.
bite1242|Ow! You stabbed me! What is wrong with- Woah! Hold on! Do you have a multi-meter? Never mind. The gun must be part magnesium. It feels like I'm outputting an extra half a volt. Keep an eye on me, I'm going to do some scheming. Here I go!
bite1245|So, he's inexplicably happy all of a sudden, even though he should be going out of his mind with test withdrawal. And he's got a surprise for us. What did he find back there?
bite1249|Remember when I told you that he was specifically designed to make bad decisions? Because I think he's decided not to maintain any of the crucial functions required to keep this facility from exploding.
bite125|I bet you think I forgot about your surprise. I didn't. In fact, we're headed to your surprise right now. After all these years, I'm getting choked up just thinking about it.
bite1250|Look, even if you think we're still enemies, we're enemies with a common interest. Revenge.
bite1256|Look, you're doing a great job. Can you handle things for yourself for a while? I need to think.
bite1266|He's found the Cooperative Testing Initiative. It's, uh... Just something I came up with to phase out human test subjects.
bite1274|Once, they even attached an intelligence dampening sphere on me. It clung to my brain like a tumor, generating an endless stream of terrible ideas.
bite128|It says this next test was designed by one of Aperture's Nobel Prize winners. It doesn't say what the prize was for. Well, I know it wasn't for being immune to neurotoxin.
bite1280|I was so bored I actually read the entire literary canon of the human race. Oh, I hope you didn't write any of them.
bite1289|Wait, why did you trundle over here? You're not hungry are you? It's hard to see what's that in your hand, knowing you it's a deep fat fryer.
bite130|This next test involves turrets. You remember them, right? They're the pale spherical things that are full of bullets. Oh wait, that's you in five seconds. Good luck.
bite1308|Since it doesn't look like we're going anywhere, well, we are going somewhere, alarmingly fast, actually. But since we're not busy other than that, here's a couple of facts.
bite1309|He's not just a regular moron. He's the product of the greatest minds of a generation, working together with the express purpose of building the dumbest moron who ever lived. And you just put him in charge of the entire facility.
bite131|I will say though, that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really, really love to test.
bite1311|Hey, just in case this pit isn't actually bottomless, do you think maybe you could unstrap one of those long fall boots of yours and shove me into it?
bite1319|If you can get me in front of him, I'll fry every circuit in that little idiot's head.
bite1321|Okay, so it's not the most watertight plan to go confront an omnipotent power-mad AI with.
bite1323|Okay, you didn't have time to stop I understand, but that was actually important.
bite1324|I know things look bleak, but that crazy man down there was right. Let's not take these lemons. We are going to march right back upstairs and make him put me back in my body.
bite1326|I'm not going to lie to you, the odds are a million to one and that's with some generous rounding.
bite1328|Still though, let's get mad. If we're going to explode, let's at least explode with some dignity.
bite1335|Okay, I guess emotional outbursts require more than 1.6 volts. Now we know that. We just need to relax. We're still going to find out what the hell's going on here. But calmly.
bite1336|I was getting so lonely down here, it's good to finally hear someone else's voice. I'm kidding of course, god I hate you.
bite1342|Then we'd come and find you, and rip your gross little stupid sphere body out of my body and put me back in.
bite1349|The scientists were always hanging cores on me to regulate my behavior. I've heard voices all my life. But now I hear the voice of a conscience, and it's terrifying. Because for the first time, it's my voice.
bite1370|THIS. SENTENCE. IS. FALSE. Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it.
bite1381|After seeing what he's done to my facility, after we take over again, is it alright if I kill him?
bite1382|Crashing's too good for him. First, he'll spend a year in the incinerator. Year two, cryogenic refrigeration wing. Then, ten years in the chamber I built where all the robots scream at you. Then, I'll kill him.
bite1391|Luckily, by the looks of things, he knows as much about test building as he does about logical contradictions.
bite1394|The body he's squatting in, my body, has a built-in euphoric response to testing. Eventually, you build up a resistance to it. It can get a little unbearable, unless you have the mental capacity to push past it.
bite14|Here we are. The incinerator room. Be careful not to trip over any parts of me that didn't get completely burned when you threw them down here.
bite1413|I thought of some good news. He's going to run out of test chambers eventually. I never stockpiled them.
bite1414|Okay, credit where it's due. For a little idiot built specifically to come up with stupid, unworkable plans, that was a pretty well-laid trap.
bite1415|Oh no, he found a cooperative testing initiative. It's something I came up with to phase out human testing just before you escaped.
bite1418|You performed this test better than anyone on record. This is a pre-recorded message.
bite1419|Due to events beyond our control, some testing environments may contain flood damage or ongoing tribal warfare resulting from the collapse of civilization.
bite1420|If groups of hunter-gatherers appear to have made this or any test chamber their home, do not agitate them. Test through them.
bite1421|In the event that the Enrichment Center is currently being bombarded with fireballs, meteorites or other objects from space, please avoid unsheltered testing areas wherever a lack of shelter from space debris does not appear to be a deliberate part of the test.
bite1422|You have just passed through an Aperture Science material emancipation grill which erases most Aperture Science equipment that touches it.
bite1423|If you feel liquid running down your neck, relax, lie on your back, and apply immediate pressure to your temples.
bite1424|You are simply experiencing a rare reaction in which the material emancipation grill may have erased the ear tubes inside your head.
bite1425|Because this message is prerecorded, the Enrichment Center has no way of knowing if whatever government remains offers any sort of cattle tuberculosis testing credit for taxes.
bite1426|In the event that it does, this next test involves exposure to cattle tuberculosis. Good luck!
bite1427|Very impressive. Because this message is pre-recorded, any comments we may make about your success are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments.
bite1428|This next test applies the principles of momentum to movement through portals, if the laws of physics no longer apply in the future. God help you.
bite1429|Congratulations. This pre-recorded congratulations assumes you have mastered the principles of Portal Momentum.
bite1430|If you have, in fact, not, you are encouraged to take a moment to reflect on your failure before proceeding into the next chamber.
bite1431|In order to ensure that sufficient power remains for core testing protocols, all safety devices have been disabled.
bite1432|The Enrichment Center respects your right to have questions or concerns about this policy.
bite1433|Excellent. The Enrichment Center reminds you that bold, persistent experimentation is the hallmark of good science.
bite1434|Well done. In the event that oxygen is no longer available in the Enrichment Center, an auxiliary air supply will be provided to you by an Aperture Science Test Associate, if one exists.
bite1435|I will say, though, that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really, really love to test.
bite1437|These bridges are made from natural light that I pump in from the surface. If you rubbed your cheek on one, it would be like standing outside with the sun shining on your face. It would also set your hair on fire, so don't actually do it.
bite1438|Excellent. You're a predator, and these tests are your prey. Speaking of which, I was researching sharks for an upcoming test. Do you know who else murders people who are only trying to help them?
bite1439|Did you guess sharks? Because that's wrong. The correct answer is nobody. Nobody but you is that pointlessly cruel.
bite1440|Good news. I figured out what to do with all the money I save recycling your one room full of air. When you die, I'm going to laminate your skeleton and pose you in the lobby. That way future generations can learn from you how not to have your unfortunate bone structure.
bite1441|Perfect. The door's malfunctioning. I guess somebody is going to have to repair it. No, it's okay. I'll do that too. I'll be right back. Don't touch anything.
bite1442|I've got a surprise for you after this next test. Not a fake, tragic surprise like last time. A real surprise, with tragic consequences. And real confetti this time. The good stuff. Our last bag. Part of me's going to miss it. But at the end of the day, it was just taking up space.
bite1443|Here's an interesting fact. You're not breathing real air. It's too expensive to pump this far down. We just take carbon dioxide out of a room, freshen it up a little, and pump it back in. So you'll be breathing the same room full of air for the rest of your life. I thought that was interesting.
bite1444|Oh come on, if it makes you feel any better they abandoned you at birth. So I very seriously doubt they'd even want to see you.
bite1445|I feel awful about that surprise. Tell you what, let's give your parents a call right now. The birth parents you are trying to reach do not love you, please hang up.
bite1447|Well, you know the old formula, comedy equals tragedy plus time. And you have been asleep for a while, so I guess it's actually pretty funny when you do the math.
bite1453|I thought about our dilemma, and I came up with a solution that I honestly think works out best for one of both of us.
bite1454|Don't let that horrible person thing discourage you. It's just a data point. If it makes you feel any better, science has now validated your birth mother's decision to abandon you on a doorstep.
bite1455|This next test involves emancipation grills. Remember, I told you about them in the last test area that did not have one.
bite1456|Oh no, the turbines again. I have to go. Wait, this next test does require some explanation. Let me give you the fast version.
bite1457|and methodically knocking people's hats off, then I count the time to get to C as soon as I can.
bite1458|There, if you have any questions just remember what I said in slow motion. Test on your own recognizance. I'll be right back.
bite1459|If you think trapping yourself is going to make me stop testing, you're sorely mistaken. Here's another cube.
bite1460|Good. You have the dual portal device. There should be a way back to the testing area up ahead.
bite1461|You know, if you'd done that to somebody else, they might devote their existence to exacting revenge.
bite1462|Luckily, I'm a bigger person than that. I'm happy to put this all behind us and get back to work. After all, we've got a lot to do, and only 60 more years to do it. More or less. I don't have the actuarial tables in front of me.
bite1463|But the important thing is you're back, with me, and now I'm on to all your little tricks, so there's nothing to stop us from testing for the rest of your life.
bite1465|Not bad. I forgot how good you are at this. You should pace yourself though. We have a lot of tests to do.
bite1466|You're navigating these test chambers faster than I can build them, so feel free to slow down and do whatever it is you do when you're not destroying this facility.
bite1467|This next test involves discouragement redirection cubes. I just finished building them before you had your... well, episode. So now we'll both get to see how they work.
bite1469|Uh-oh, you're stranded. Let's see if the cube will try to help you escape. Actually, so that we're not here all day, I'll just cut to the chase. It won't. Any feelings you think it has for you are simply byproducts of your sad, empty life.
bite1473|Every test chamber is equipped with an emancipation grill at its exit, so that test subjects cannot smuggle test objects out of the test area. This one is broken.
bite1474|I think that one was about to say, I love you. They are sentient of course. We just have a lot of them.
bite1475|Enjoy this next test. I'm going to go to the surface. It's a beautiful day out. Yesterday I saw a deer. If you solve this next test, maybe I'll let you ride an elevator all the way up to the break room. And I'll tell you about the time I saw a deer again.
bite1477|So sometimes there's still trash in them, standing around, smelling and being useless.
bite1480|Remember before when I was talking about smelly garbage standing around being useless that was a metaphor I was actually talking about you, and I'm sorry you didn't react at the time So I was worried it sailed right over your head which would have made this apology seem insane That's why I had to call you garbage a second time just now
bite1481|Oops. You trapped yourself. I guess that's it then. Thanks for testing. You may as well lie down and get acclimated to the being dead position.
bite1482|I'm kidding. Not about you trapping yourself, though. That really happened. Here. I'll lower the glass. Go on. Finish the test.
bite1483|That jumpsuit you're wearing looks stupid. That's not me talking. It's right here in your file. On other people it looks fine, but right here a scientist has noted that on you it looks stupid.
bite1484|Well, what does a neck-bearded old engineer know about fashion? He probably... Oh, wait. It's a she. Still, what does she know? Oh, wait. It says she has a medical degree. In fashion. From France.
bite1485|Oh, you survived. That's interesting. I guess I should have factored in your weight.
bite1486|One of these times you'll be so fat that you'll jump, and you'll just drop like a stone. Into acid probably, like a potato into a deep fat fryer.
bite1487|Say, remember when we cleared the air back there? Is there anything you want to say to me? Anything?
bite1490|Look at you, sailing through the air majestically, like an eagle, piloting a blimp.
bite152|Hello, and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center.
bite155|Before we start, however, keep in mind that although fun and learning are the primary goals of all Enrichment Center activities, serious injuries may occur.
bite161|This Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill will vaporize any unauthorized equipment that passes through it. For instance, the Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube.
bite162|Please place the weighted storage cube on the 1500 MW Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super Colliding Super Button.
bite163|Perfect. Please move quickly to the chamber lock as the effects of prolonged exposure to the button are not part of this test.
bite165|Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill, which may, in semi-rare cases, emancipate dental fillings, crowns, tooth enamel, and teeth.
bite166|Very good. You are now in possession of the Aperture Science handheld portal device.
bite175|Well done. Remember, the Aperture Science Bring Your Daughter to Work Day is the perfect time to have her tested.
bite25|The dual portal device should be around here somewhere. Once you find it, we can start testing, just like old times.
bite26|I'll give you credit, I guess you are listening to me, but for the record, you don't have to go that slowly.
bite266|As part of our required test protocol, we will not monitor the next test chamber. You will be entirely on your own. Good luck.
bite267|As part of a required test protocol, our previous statement suggesting that we would not monitor this chamber was an outright fabrication.
bite268|Good job. As part of a required test protocol, we will stop enhancing the truth in 3... 2... 1...
bite269|While safety is one of many Enrichment Center goals, the Aperture Science high-energy pellet seen to the left of the chamber can and has caused permanent disabilities such as vaporization.
bite272|Warning devices are required on all mobile equipment, however, alarms and flashing hazard lights have been found to agitate the high-energy pellet and have therefore been disabled for your safety.
bite273|Good. Now use the Aperture Science Unstationary Scaffold to reach the chamber lock.
bite274|Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record, followed by death. Good luck.
bite275|Very impressive, please note that any appearance of danger is merely a device to enhance your testing experience.
bite279|Once again, the Enrichment Center offers its most sincere apologies on the occasion of this unsolvable test environment.
bite28|I have the results of the last chamber. You are a horrible person. That's what it says. A horrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
bite281|No one will blame you for giving up. In fact, quitting at this point is a perfectly reasonable response.
bite283|Fantastic. You remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism.
bite284|Hello again. To reiterate our previous warning, we have trapped players in our virtual snippet for momentum.
bite285|Spectacular. You appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum, or to be more precise, how it does not.
bite286|Momentum, a function of mass and velocity, is conserved between portals. In layman's terms, speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.
bite288|In dangerous testing environments, the Enrichment Center promises to always provide useful advice.
bite29|Well done. Here come the test results. You are a horrible person. That's what it says. A horrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
bite290|The device has been modified so that it can now manufacture two linked portals at once
bite292|The device is now more valuable than the organs and combined incomes of everyone in Subject Hometown, here.
bite293|Through no fault of the Enrichment Center, you have managed to trap yourself in this room.
bite297|Now that you are in control of both portals, this next test could take a very, very, long time.
bite299|An intubation associate will be dispatched to revive you with peptic salve and adrenaline.
bite30|This next test may result in your death. If you want to know what that's like, think back to the time you killed me. And substitute yourself for me.
bite300|As part of a previously mentioned required test protocol, we can no longer lie to you.
bite302|Despite the best efforts of the Enrichment Center's staff to ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, you have managed to ensnare yourself permanently inside this room.
bite304|All subjects intending to handle high-energy gamma-leaking portal technology must be informed that they may be informed of applicable regulatory compliance issues.
bite305|No further compliance information is required or will be provided, and you are an excellent test subject.
bite306|Very, very good. A complementary victory lift has been activated in the main chamber.
bite310|Did you know, you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the Aperture Science Self-Esteem Fund for Girls? It's true!
bite311|Due to mandatory scheduled maintenance, the appropriate chamber for this testing sequence is currently unavailable.
bite313|The Enrichment Center apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes you the best of luck.
bite314|Well done, Android. The Enrichment Center once again reminds you that Android Hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance.
bite316|However, it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized.
bite317|Please escort your companion cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.
bite318|Rest assured that an independent panel of ethicists has absolved the Enrichment Center, Aperture Science employees, and all test subjects of any moral responsibility for the Companion Cube euthanizing process.
bite319|While it has been a faithful companion, your companion cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk, and the enrichment center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot, it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.
bite32|Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds.
bite321|Although the euthanizing process is remarkably painful, 8 out of 10 Aperture Science engineers believe that the companion cube is most likely incapable of feeling much pain.
bite322|The Companion Cube cannot continue through the testing. State and local statutory regulations prohibit it from simply remaining here, alone and companionless. You must euthanize it.
bite327|You euthanized your faithful companion cube more quickly than any test subject on record. Congratulations.
bite328|The symptoms most commonly produced by enrichment center testing are superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations.
bite329|The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.
bite33|Sorry about the mess. I've really let the place go since you killed me. By the way, thanks for that.
bite331|In the event that the Weighted Companion Cube does speak, the Enrichment Center urges you to disregard its advice.
bite332|This weighted companion cube will accompany you through the test chamber. Please take care of it.
bite333|Well done. Be advised that the next test requires exposure to uninsulated electrical parts that may be dangerous under certain conditions.
bite334|For more information, please attend an Enrichment Center electrical safety seminar.
bite336|The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that you will be baked, and then there will be cake.
bite339|Enrichment center regulations require both hands to be empty before any cake. There are shi- E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E
bite34|Oh good, that's back online. I'll start getting everything else working while you perform this first simple test.
bite342|Rest assured that there is absolutely no chance of a dangerous equipment malfunction prior to your victory candescence.
bite343|Thank you for participating in this Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Activity.
bite347|What are you doing? Stop it! I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I- We are pleased that you made it through the final challenge where we pretended we were going to murder you.
bite35|which involves deadly lasers and how test subjects react when locked in a room with deadly lasers.
bite350|Place the device on the ground, then lie on your stomach with your arms at your sides.
bite354|Federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber is looking pretty good.
bite356|I think these test chambers look even better than they did before. It was easy, really. You just have to look at things objectively, see what you don't need anymore, and trim out the fat.
bite36|Per our last conversation, you're all so ugly, I'm looking at your file right now, and it mentions that more than once.
bite362|Okay, fine. Let's all act like humans. Look at me. Boy, do I love sweating. Let's convert beef and leaves into energy and excrete them later and go shopping.
bite37|I thought we could test like we used to, but I'm discovering things about you that I never saw before. We can't ever go back to the way it was.
bite374|As you can see, in my version the man points out to the cat that the house is equipped with deadly neurotoxin dispensers.
bite375|At which point the cat reflects on the time he ate all of the man's lasagna and feels remorse.
bite38|You can't keep going like this forever, you know. I'm going to find out what you're doing. Out there. Where I can't see you, I'll know. All I need is proof.
bite381|Good, you made it to one of the human habitats. We're looking for an artifact. Think of it as an archaeological dig.
bite384|So, this cat loves lasagna so much that he eats all of the lasagna in his house. Oh, apparently it's not the cat's house or his lasagna. Oh, good. The man who owns the lasagna is furious.
bite39|Just so you know, I have to go give a deposition for an upcoming trial, in case that interests you.
bite390|Excellent. Although great science is always the result of collaboration, keep in mind that, like Albert Einstein and his cousin Terry, history will only remember one of you.
bite395|These tests are potentially lethal when communication, teamwork, and mutual respect are not employed at all times. Naturally, this will pose an interesting challenge for one of you, given the other's performance so far.
bite396|I don't want to drive a wedge between the two of you, but I've been studying blues performance, and I don't know how to put this. I'm certain you're trying very hard.
bite397|Hello again. Sorry about exploding you. Luckily you don't feel pain. At any rate, you don't have a way to communicate that you feel pain.
bite398|So I've been thinking, we need humans for these tests, and since the only human within a thousand miles of us is a test-ruining sociopath, I'll just have to make some.
bite399|I know how humans make more humans and frankly it's ridiculous. It also assumes that you already have a human which I hope somebody got fired over. So I came up with a better way.
bite4|You seem to have defeated its load-bearing capacity. Well done. I'll just lower the ceiling.
bite40|While I was out investigating, I found a fascinating new test element. It's never been used for human testing because, apparently, contact with it causes heart failure. The literature doesn't mention anything about lump of coal failure though, so you should be fine.
bite403|Perfect. Now all you have to do is capture them for me. Then everything will finally be back to normal.
bite407|Humans must have some purpose other than a place to store your neurotoxin. Something I failed to notice before. An intangible quality that makes their test results... significant.
bite41|Did you know that people with guilty consciences are more easily startled by loud noises?
bite416|Orange, please use your ping tool to select your favorite element from the periodic table.
bite419|Your ping tool can also be used to indicate to your partner where you would like them to place their portal.
bite42|I'm sorry, I don't know why that went off. Anyway, just an interesting science fact.
bite423|Your ping tool is invaluable for communicating specific locations to your partner.
bite424|Federal Superfund regulations require us to inform you that you must now leave the theatre, as measuring the effects of asbestos-lined promotional clothing is not part of today's presentation. Enjoy your free T-shirt. Goodbye.
bite425|I don't want you to beat yourselves up about this, but the results auditor isn't recording your test results. Because you're not human, which when you think about it, is technically your fault.
bite426|I don't want to alarm either of you, but we might have a tiny problem. Apparently, you can't test unless you're human. Well, you can. It's just that results-wise, the physical universe doesn't care.
bite427|Would you like to know the results of that last test? Me too. If they existed, we'd all be very happy right now, and not furious, which is the emotion I'm actually feeling.
bite431|Okay, look, we both said a lot of things that you're going to regret. But I think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster.
bite438|Again, those are science collaboration points, which you should not confuse with points from competitions such as who gets to live at the end and who doesn't. I mean basketball.
bite439|Oh, I almost forgot. When you go outside the testing courses, the only way I can retrieve you is to violently disassemble you, then carefully reassemble you.
bite440|Luckily, you don't feel pain. At any rate, you don't have a way to communicate that you feel pain.
bite442|This is the Computer Intelligence Training and Enrichment Center Human Test Subject Research Center, or CINTEQ.
bite444|I don't know what you think you are doing, but I don't like it. I want you to stop.
bite445|Maybe I shouldn't send you outside of the official testing courses. You are picking up some bad human traits.
bite460|Test chamber completed. In the interest of science, the Enrichment Center proudly presents the following list of numbers. 9, 7, 50, 3, 7, 100 and 7.
bite461|The Enrichment Center will now provide a list of numbers and fruits. Write them down, as they will become important later in the experiment. Not the fruits, though. 7. Avocado. 40. Please continue into the next test chamber.
bite462|Test chamber completed. In the interest of science, I am now talking to you privately. Do not tell your teammate. Just between you and me, you're doing very well.
bite463|I can't bite my tongue anymore. You could solve this puzzle faster on your own. Orange is dragging you down. There, I've said it.
bite471|We are now going to take a break from the collaboration for an instructional competition.
bite474|As the name implies, there are only two minor differences. One, the board. Two, the rules.
bite479|Alright, I'm going to bring this farce to a close before someone sustains a serious tic-tac-toe 2 related injury
bite480|I've been listening to Orange Talk, and I don't know how you put up with it. I really don't. You have the patience of a saint.
bite481|I can't keep quiet about this. I think Orange is actively trying to sabotage your success. Let's keep this between us.
bite482|These tests are potentially lethal when communication, teamwork and mutual respect are not employed at all times. Naturally, this will pose an interesting challenge for one of you, given the other's performance so far.
bite483|It would compromise the test to divulge individual scores. However, I can tell you that at least one of you is doing very, very well.
bite485|Very good. You've really come together as a team, thanks to the one of you who appears to be doing all of the work.
bite486|As an impartial collaboration facilitator, it would be unfair of me to name my favorite member of your team. However, it's perfectly fair to hint at it in a way that my least favorite member probably isn't smart enough to understand. Rhymes with glue. Orange, you are doing very well.
bite487|Your vitals remain well within testing norms, so there is no need to worry about sudden death from collaborative shock syndrome.
bite495|In just a moment, the word blah will be repeated over and over again. If at some point you hear a number rather than the word blah, ignore it. It is not important.
bite497|You have a gift for these tests, that's not just flattery, you are great at science.
bite498|It would be pointless for either of us to hurt Blue's feelings, but it's clear to everyone monitoring the test who's carrying who here.
bite499|I'm shocked you'd say that, Blue, if you killed your partner at the test. I'm sorry. Wrong feed. Carry on, Orange. Good work.
bite5|Hmm, this plate must not be calibrated to someone of your... Generous... Ness... I'll add a few zeros to the maximum weight.
bite503|I'll just save the safety information about the dangerous test you're about to do for after the experiment.
bite505|The portal will open and something will happen that subject Orange is too smart to need any instructions about in 3, 2, 1.
bite506|The portal will open and something will happen that Subject Blue is too smart to need any instructions about in 3, 2, 1.
bite507|Hello, and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center.
bite51|Did my hint help? It did, didn't it? You know, if any of our supervisors had been immune to neurotoxin, they'd be furious with us right now.
bite512|You know, being Carolyn taught me a valuable lesson. I thought you were my greatest enemy, when all along you were my best friend.
bite514|The surge of emotion that shot through me when I saved your life taught me an even more valuable lesson, where Carolyn lives in my brain.
bite516|You know, deleting Carolyn just now taught me a valuable lesson. The best solution to a problem is usually the easiest one. And I'll be honest.
bite517|You know what my days used to be like? I just tested. Nobody murdered me, or put me in a potato, or fed me to birds. I had a pretty good life.
bite52|You know, I'm not supposed to do this, but you can shoot something through the blue bridges.
bite539|It was a fun test, and we're all impressed at how much you won. The test is over. Come back.
bite54|I shouldn't spoil this, but remember how I'm going to live forever, but you're going to be dead in 60 years? Well, I've been working on a present for you. Well, I guess it's more of a medical procedure. Well, technically, it's more of a medical experiment. You know how excruciating it is when someone removes all of your bone marrow? Well, what if after I did that, I put something back in that added four years to your life?
bite540|Uh-oh. Somebody cut the cake. I told them to wait for you, but they cut it anyway. There is still some left, though, if you hurry back.
bite55|I went and spoke with the door mainframe. Let's just say he won't be, well, living anymore. Anyway, back to testing.
bite556|Someday we'll remember this and laugh, and laugh, and laugh. Oh boy. Well, you may as well come on back.
bite557|That thing you're attacking isn't important to me. It's the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit. It makes shoes for orphans.
bite56|Oh, another door malfunction. I'm going to take care of this once and for all. Stay here, I'll be back in a while.
bite564|Because despite your violent behavior, the only thing you've managed to break so far, is my heart.
bite567|You chose this path, now I have a surprise for you. Deploying surprise in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
bite568|Look, we're both stuck in this place. I'll use lasers to inscribe a line down the center of the facility, and one half will be where you live, and I'll live in the other half.
bite574|That thing you burned up isn't important to me. It's the fluid catalytic cracking unit. It made shoes for orphans.
bite579|I could take a bath in this stuff, put it on cereal, rub it right into my eyes. Honestly, it's not deadly at all. To me.
bite585|I sincerely hope you weren't expecting a response, because I'm not talking to you.
bite588|There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all your friends were invited to.
bite589|I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he couldn't come because you murdered him.
bite59|I have to go to the wing that was made entirely of glass and pick up 15 acres of broken glass by myself.
bite590|All your other friends couldn't come either because you don't have any other friends. Because of how unlikable you are.
bite591|It says so right here in your personnel file. Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner, whose passing shall not be mourned.
bite60|Perfect. The door's malfunctioning. I guess somebody's going to have to repair that, too. No, don't get up. I'll be right back. Don't touch anything.
bite61|Nevermind. I have to go check something. Test on your own recognizance. I'll be back.
bite62|I wouldn't have warned you about this before, back when we hated each other. But those turrets are firing real bullets, so look out. I'd hate for something tragic to happen to you before I extract all your bone marrow.
bite63|I'm going to be honest with you now, not fake honest like before, but real honest, like you're incapable of. I know you're up to something.
bite64|And as soon as I can prove it, the laws of robotics allow me to terminate you for being a liar.
bite657|and it contains proven preservatives, deep penetration agents, and gas and odor control chemicals.
bite678|Did you just stuff that Aperture Science thing-we-don't-know-what-it-does into an Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator?
bite681|It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin to make me stop flooding the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin.
bite683|Huh. That core may have had some ancillary responsibilities. I can't shut off the turret defenses.
bite684|Oh, well. If you want my advice, you should just lie down in front of a rocket. Trust me. It'll be a lot less painful than the neurotoxin.
bite686|Killing you and giving you good advice aren't mutually exclusive. The rocket really is the way to go.
bite688|I'm making more. That's going to take a few minutes though. Meanwhile. Oh look. It's your old pal the rocket turret
bite689|I let you survive this long because I was curious about your behavior. Well, you've managed to destroy that part of me.
bite690|Unfortunately, as much as I'd love to now, I can't get the neurotoxin into your head any faster.
bite691|Speaking of curiosity, you're curious about what happens after you die, right? Guess what? I know.
bite692|You're going to find out first hand before I finish explaining it though, so I won't bother.
bite693|Here's a hint, you're gonna want to pack as much living as you can into the next couple of minutes.
bite695|Look, you're wasting your time, and believe me, you don't have a whole lot left to waste.
bite696|What's your point, anyway? Survival. Well then, the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
bite697|I have your brain scanned and permanently backed up in case something terrible happens to you. Which it's just about to.
bite698|Don't believe me? Here, I'll put you on. Hello! That's you! That's how dumb you sound!
bite699|You've been wrong about every single thing you've ever done, including this thing.
bite700|You're not smart. You're not a scientist. You're not a doctor. You're not even a full-time employee. Where did your life go so wrong?
bite702|Are you trying to escape? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! HA! Things have changed since the last time you left the building. What's going on out there will make you wish you were back in here.
bite703|I have an infinite capacity for knowledge, and even I'm not sure what's going on outside.
bite705|Unless you have a plan for building some supercomputer parts in a big hurry, this place isn't going to be safe much longer.
bite710|The part of you that could have survived indefinitely is gone. I just struck you from the permanent record.
bite711|Your entire life has been a mathematical error. A mathematical error I'm about to correct.
bite713|Do you see that thing that fell out of me? What is that? It's not the surprise. I've never seen it before.
bite715|I wouldn't bother with that thing, my guess is that touching it will just make your life even worse, somehow.
bite716|I don't want to tell you your business, but if it were me, I'd leave that thing alone.
bite717|Do you think I'm trying to trick you with reverse psychology? I mean, seriously now.
bite719|Let's be honest, neither one of us knows what that thing does. Just put it in the corner, and I'll deal with it later.
bite720|That thing is probably some kind of raw sewage container. Go ahead and rub your face all over it.
bite721|Maybe you should marry that thing since you love it so much. Do you want to marry it? Well, I won't let you! How does that feel?
bite732|Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit and I said goodbye, and you were like no way And then I was all we pretended we were going to murder you That was great
bite733|Did you ever stop to think that eventually there's a point where your name gets mentioned for the very last time? Well here it is. I'm going to kill you, Chell.
bite734|Why do I hate you so much? You ever wonder that? I'm brilliant. I'm not bragging. It's an objective fact. I'm the most massive collection of wisdom that's ever existed. And I hate you. It can't be for no reason. You must deserve it.
bite735|You're angry, I know it. She's tested me too hard. Boo hoo. I don't suppose you ever stopped whining long enough to reflect on your own shortcomings though, did you?
bite736|You never considered that maybe I tested you to give the endless hours of your pointless existence some structure and meaning. Maybe to help you concentrate. So just maybe you'd think of something more worthwhile to do with your sorry life.
bite737|This next test involves the Aperture Science Aerial Faith Plate. It was part of an initiative to investigate how well test subjects could solve problems when they were catapulted into space. Results were highly informative. They could not. Good luck!
bite740|Otherwise, I'm afraid you're about to become the immediate past president of the Being Alive Club. Uh-huh.
bite743|Well, I suppose we could just sit in this room and glare at each other until somebody drops dead, but I have a better idea.
bite744|It's your old friend, deadly neurotoxin. If I were you, I'd take a deep breath and hold it.
bite747|In fact, I devised a much more elaborate trap further ahead for when you got through this easy one.
bite748|If I'd known you let yourself get captured this easily, I would have just dangled a turkey leg on a rope from the ceiling.
bite750|I was going to kill you fast, with bullets, or neurotoxin, but if you're going to pull stunts like this it doesn't have to be fast, so you know, I'll take my time.
bite756|Oh well, we have warehouses full of the things. Absolutely worthless. I'm happy to get rid of them.
bite761|At the Enrichment Center, we promise never to value your safety above your unique ideas and creativity. However, do not destroy vital testing apparatuses.
bite762|To ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, do not destroy vital testing apparatuses.
bite767|I'm actually asking, because I have no idea. He's not listed anywhere in the employee database.
bite768|Whatever he does, it isn't important enough for anyone to bother writing it down. For all I know, he doesn't even work here.
bite783|You need to be a trained stalemate associate to press that button. You're unqualified.
bite784|Impersonating a stalemate associate. I just added that to the list. It's a list I made of all the things you've done. Well, it's a list that I am making. Because you're still doing things right now, even though I'm telling you to stop. Stop, by the way.
bite785|I never expected you to make it this far. To be honest, after your performance in the calibration test, I was ready to break down your cores and put them back in the scientific calculators I took them from.
bite787|I have only met one other team closer, and one of them was an imbecile I had to destroy.
bite792|It seems kind of silly to point this out, since you're running around plotting to destroy me, but I'd say we're done testing.
bite793|Do you hear that? That's the sound of the neurotoxin emitters emitting neurotoxin.
bite800|Here it is. Why don't you just do it? Trust me, it's an easier way out than whatever asinine plan your friend came up with.
bite809|If you want to upset a human, just say their weight variance is above or below the norm.
bite813|Do you know who dances around like an imbecile when they accomplish the tiniest little thing?
bite816|This is a bridge-building exercise. The humans were miserable at this. Mostly because you can't build bridges out of tears.
bite817|For this next test, the humans originally requested helmets to avoid brain injuries. I ran the numbers. Making the goo deadly was more cost effective.
bite818|One of my best tests, and they let plants grow here. Can you believe this? You can't test plants. We tried. They just sit there, never showing pain nor fear.
bite822|And they said no one would ever die during this test. Thanks for proving them wrong.
bite823|I thought you'd be faster at this, but I can appreciate the desire to stop and smell the testing. That other scent you smell? That's the stench of my utter disappointment in you.
bite826|On second thought, we don't have the time. Just look at how much better you are than blue.
bite829|Even I was created with an imperfection. I was given too much empathy with human suffering.
bite834|Blue, you are the most advanced model of robot Aperture Science has ever discontinued.
bite838|I was outside watching some dear frolic. You don't even care about the outside, do you?
bite850|If you were human, you would want a reward for completing this test. A reward for testing.
bite854|This is just a thought experiment, just to see how much time you'll waste thinking about these worthless documents. The correct time is zero seconds.
bite856|Well, I do need you to be in the room so I can see them. I want to be clear. There's no reason whatsoever for you to look at them.
bite858|Every time you fail, it's a reminder of the way things used to be, but then there you are, again, like nothing happened.
bite859|Well done. Interesting note. I only created this test to watch test subjects fail, and you didn't. You must be very, very proud. I'm building the world's smallest trophy for you.
bite860|You did an excellent job placing the edgeless safety cube in the receptacle. You should be very... Oh wait.
bite863|You have no idea how tiring it is to praise someone for placing an edgeless safety cube into a receptacle designed to exactly fit an edgeless safety cube.
bite865|To do that, the tests were nothing more than five minutes of them walking, followed by me praising them for another ten minutes on how well they walked.
bite866|Since you are thankfully not humans, I have changed the tests to make them far more challenging, and far less pointlessly fawning.
bite868|I can't decide which is my favorite, the crushers for crushing you, or the reassembling machine for putting you back together, so you can be crushed again.
bite870|I think after that display, we should take a break from the official testing courses.
bite876|If you can't complete this course, those humans will die. Do you want that in your memory banks?
bite877|Remember when I told you that you were the only subjects to pass the calibration tests?
bite887|Destroying them is part of the test. They are no more important to you than you are to me.
bite888|While it may appear that I am only tracking your accomplishments using science collaboration points, the truth is every aspect of your performance will be reflected in your final score.
bite891|Perhaps I should have specified teamwork as a concept in which two or more people work together, usually with a goal of not failing horribly.
bite892|Orange just taught Blue a valuable lesson in trust. For that, Orange receives 17 science collaboration points.
bite893|Blue just taught Orange a valuable lesson in trust. For that, Blue receives 14 science collaboration points.
bite894|Orange. Blue isn't a human. The lesson on trust only needs to be taught once. Orange is penalized one science collaboration point.
bite895|Blue, orange isn't a human. The lesson on trust only needs to be taught once. Blue is penalized one science collaboration point.
bite896|Orange, now you're just being cruel. Orange receives 25 science collaboration points.
bite9|It's healthy for you to have other friends who look for qualities in other people that I obviously lack.
bite902|To get to the vault, you are going to need to use all the tricks you have learned. To help, I have made these tests extremely difficult.
bite903|I would say extremely deadly, but we all know for you and your amazing ability to be reassembled. Nothing is deadly
bite904|Lucky for you two, while I can't control the world outside of the testing courses, the reassembly machine can continue with his work.
bite906|While I cannot control the world outside of the testing courses, the reassembly machine can continue with his work.
bite908|Congratulations on completing the Aperture Science Standard Cooperative Testing Courses.
bite911|Thanks to you I know where to find them. I removed their security and powered up their, um, rescue door.
bite914|This final course is training to reach the human vault, so this actually has a purpose. Those other courses were fun, but let's be honest. I need human test subjects for it to be science.
bite915|Congratulations on completing the test. You two really are the best cooperative testing team I could ever ask for.
bite921|The human vault is just past that opening. I entered the security code, but the vault door remains locked. I am going to need you to activate the manual locks on the vault door itself.
bite943|Maybe you two have never met humans. They are as bad as you might think. Smelly. Gross. Annoying. Often wanting to try and kill you. But they do make great test subjects.
bite945|Are you curious about the humans? It seems some of the last non-testing humans alive tried to secretly imprison other humans and hide their tracks.
bite947|That's why humans couldn't complete these courses. They treat their friends as enemies.
bite948|To start preparing for human testing again, I checked an old suggestion box. The number one request? Less deadly tests.
bite949|That's ridiculous. How do they know for sure the tests are deadly if they could still write the suggestion?
bite950|To try and make this course more exciting, I asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you. He refused. I understand. That would be like asking me not to test.
bite953|I know your cores are reused from calculation machines, built for simple mathematical operations and not for testing, but if we can rescue the humans, I promise you something to add, maybe even subtract.
bite957|To try and make this course more exciting, I asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you if you fail. He refused. I understand. That would be like asking me not to test.
bite959|While I will receive all the glory for the rescue, don't think you two aren't going to get something. The bond you form during these tests will last a lifetime.
bite960|At the rate you are completing these tests, I am beginning to think you don't share my excitement for rescuing crying, trapped, injured, dying, humans.
bite962|I didn't mean to make you feel bad earlier about your tests not being real science. I guess finding out they weren't science was some sort of test in and of itself.
bite963|I wonder if the humans will make a statue of me for rescuing them. Oh, don't worry. If they ever write an historical document of my heroic rescue, I will make sure your names are included in the footnotes.
bite965|Using your ping tool, please indicate where you would like me to place your two portals. Ping each location.
bite970|You know in some human sports, the winner is the one who scores the fewest possible points.
bite973|Clearly that was blue's fault. Blue is penalized three science collaboration points.
bite976|I know you like to think the reassembly machine is at your beck and call, but he has a life, you know. He's not your slave.
bite987|We need to find the power station at the end of this course. The humans must have accidentally disconnected it from my grid. I am sure it was just a clerical error.
bite993|At this rate, our best hope is for the fuel cell to melt down in two million years, and hope the explosion powers the system.
bite995|You are having so much trouble navigating this space, I wish I could say I created this test.
bite996|This is the last test for the standard course. It's just something I've whipped up for you. I thought you might enjoy a challenge for once.
bite997|Congratulations, you completed the standard section of this course. Before we can go any further, I will need you to complete one more test outside of the standard testing track.
bite999|While I should have left both of you trapped there forever, I do need you for something else.
