bite1|Well, I'm back. The aerial faith plate in here is sending a distress signal.
bite10|Well done. You know, when I woke up and saw the state of the labs, I started to wonder if there was any point to going on. I came that close to just giving up and letting you go.
bite100|Alright. I'm officially no longer paying attention to you.
bite1000|You both made it. It seems no matter what I try to do to pull you apart or destroy you, you just keep going. Keep testing.
bite1001|Don't either of you have drive to be better than the other?
bite1002|It's like you're just machines.
bite1003|At the start of this course, I was worried you were becoming too close. But in my attempt to drive you apart, I learned something important about trust and betrayal.
bite1004|Your brains are too small to feel either of those emotions, so I can trust you 100%.
bite1005|Since I never expected you to make it this far, I have to build this new course just for you.
bite1006|Sometimes testing has to occur outside the confines of the lab.
bite1007|This next test is so outside the box I can't, I mean won't even tell you what you are looking for.
bite1008|You will know it when you find it.
bite1009|The two of you have forged an excellent partnership, with one of you handling the cerebral challenges, and the other ready to ponderously waddle into action should the test suddenly become an eating contest.
bite101|You're the type of show-off who only shows off really stupid things.
bite1010|I thought going back to these old tests would satisfy me. But try as you might to fail this next test, I still won't be satisfied.
bite1011|Congratulations. I am sure if I had the time to repair these tests, you would have never completed them. So again, congratulations on completing the broken, easy tests.
bite1012|This was another test no one had ever completed before you two. Oh, the science we used to learn with this test. Now, the test is useless.
bite1013|No one has ever completed this test before. The humans must have reconfigured it from my original plans.
bite1014|Excellent.
bite1015|See, nothing bad happened.
bite1016|I am going to risk having you go outside the official courses one more time.
bite1017|The humans accidentally forgot to put a security DVD in the player.
bite1018|I am sure it happened by accident, but why don't you put it back in the player?
bite1019|for safety.
bite102|It appears you're developing human traits, the worst human traits.
bite1020|I created this test to let the humans feel good about themselves. It is extremely easy. Just follow the arrows.
bite1021|I'm sorry. The arrows seem to have rusted off. Good luck.
bite1022|Congratulations. Your ability to complete this test proves the humans wrong. They described it as impossible, deadly, cruel, and one test subject even had the nerve to call it broken.
bite1023|Of course, the humans only had one try at it. You can just keep trying.
bite1024|Your failing gives me no new data. It just delays the inevitable.
bite1025|This course was created and then abandoned by humans. They tend to do that, create something wonderful, and then abandon it.
bite1026|Do you know why they abandoned this course? Too deadly.
bite1027|You did very well.
bite1028|The humans closed this test because they said it was too deadly. I thought they would have moved it into the testing track hall of fame for that. Not let it deteriorate.
bite1029|You only failed.
bite103|Be careful. Hugging can lead to... well, me disassembling you forever.
bite1030|times in this test. Not that it matters. It doesn't. So congratulations on a job well done.
bite1031|You failed so many times in this test, I thought you were becoming human. But then you would just come back again. And again. And again.
bite1032|Humans find that an admirable trait.
bite1033|Let's look at their files.
bite1034|Not a team player.
bite1035|Horrible people skills.

bite1057|timid
bite1058|Lacks confidence.
bite1059|Underestimate scope of work, they all do.
bite106|I'll interpret that gesture to mean that you want me to become even more vindictive toward you.

bite107|Orange, I certainly expected more from you.
bite1070|avoids responsibility.
bite1071|Never completes work.
bite1072|Laughs at own jokes. What a bore.
bite1073|BUSYBODY
bite1074|Ignores directions
bite1075|Stubborn.
bite1076|Lactose intolerant.
bite1077|Antagonistic. I don't know about that.
bite1078|Participates unconstructively. Obviously a time waster.
bite1079|Violent temper. Ooh, I'd like to see that.
bite108|Blue, don't sink to orange's level.
bite1080|Always weeping. Poor thing.
bite1081|Maudie
bite1082|Wet Blanket
bite1083|STUBBORN!
bite1084|Love's sound of own voice. Well, I can fix that.
bite1085|Always cold.
bite1086|Always leaves tiny little bit of coffee in the pot so they don't have to make a new one. Then the bit in the bottom burns and stinks up the place.
bite1087|Chronic anxiety, oh, I can work with that.
bite1088|DULL EXPRESSION
bite1089|Hopeless. Just hopeless.
bite109|Now you're thinking with stupidity.
bite1090|Never flushes.
bite1091|Irritable.
bite1092|Startles easily. Boop.
bite1093|FACIAL GRIMACING
bite1094|Weak, tired, and apprehensive. Wow, this one's the total package.
bite1095|has irritating opinions.
bite1096|poor self esteem
bite1097|Frequent mood swings
bite1098|hostile to new ideas.
bite1099|Always sad.
bite11|But now, looking around, seeing Aperture restored to its former glory, you don't have to worry about leaving ever again. I mean that.
bite110|Now you're just not thinking.
bite1100|Frequent bouts of uncontrollable rage.
bite1101|Seeks out conflicts with co-workers.
bite1102|Hygiene. Hmm. That's all it says.
bite1103|Unconstructive.
bite1104|Antisocial.
bite1105|Choose with mouth open.

bite1114|Charmless.

bite1116|lacks charisma.
bite1117|Passive-aggressive.
bite1118|undermines others.
bite1119|Hairless. Hmm.
bite112|You're going to hurt yourself doing that, and then I will be... ecstatic.
bite1120|Emotional problems.
bite1121|Problems with authority
bite1122|Has episodes. I'd like to know more about that.
bite1123|Abrasive personality.
bite1124|Well, enough about that first person's file, let's look at some others.
bite1125|Just stop it already.
bite1126|And that makes ten.
bite1127|You really don't need to keep failing.
bite1128|If at first you don't succeed, fail five more times.
bite1129|If I made these tests any easier, they wouldn't be tests.
bite113|I'm starting to think giving you arms was a big mistake.
bite1130|Yay, Orange is back. Testing can continue.
bite1131|Yay. Blue is back. Testing can continue.
bite1132|Are you testing me?
bite1133|Did you know the reassembly machine has other things it could be reassembling?
bite1134|Did you think that would be funny?
bite1135|How can you fail at this? It isn't even a test.
bite1136|I hope that was some kind of joke.
bite1137|I honestly never thought we would need to track how many times you died in the hub.
bite1138|And here I thought this room was dangerously unlethal.
bite1139|That worked just like you said it would, Blue.
bite114|Did you know, I discovered a way to eradicate poverty, but then you killed me, so that's gone.
bite1140|Orange, your plan is working perfectly.
bite1141|Blue, why did you do that to Orange?
bite1142|Was that necessary?
bite1143|Welcome back to the Computer Intelligence Training and Enrichment Center Human Test Subject Research Center. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
bite1144|Welcome back to the Computer Intelligence Training and Enrichment Center Human Test Subject Research Center.
bite1145|Welcome back. Testing is available.
bite1146|Welcome back, quitters. Maybe you can find another course for you to fail.
bite1147|Welcome back to the Hub. Did you fail at selecting the correct course?
bite1148|Was that course too difficult?
bite1149|Look who's back! Were you scared to continue those tests?
bite115|Waddle over to the elevator and we'll continue the testing.
bite1150|Look who's back. Were you scared to continue those tests?
bite1151|Hello again. Did you know these are the only set of tests available to you? You are going to need to select them again.
bite1152|If at first you don't succeed, quit, and try another course.
bite1153|Back again? Maybe you can just stay and live here in the hub.
bite1154|Back again? Maybe you can just stay and live here.
bite1155|I guess quitting that course together is a sign of teamwork.
bite1156|The way you two just gave up on that test together shows you are really working as a team.
bite1157|Are you scared to save those humans?
bite1158|Are you scared to save those humans?
bite1159|Blue, I wouldn't have trusted Orange in that course either.
bite116|Anything. Take your time.
bite1160|Did you know we originally used these cameras to capture moments of intense pain and agony in test subjects?
bite1161|If the subject survived the test, we let them purchase the pictures for $5. If the subject died, we gave the photo to their next of kin, free of charge.
bite1162|The photos weren't as popular as we had hoped, so we repurposed the cameras.
bite1163|Credit where credit's due. You're both doing a great job of disappointing me.
bite1164|I just hate blue a little more.
bite1165|I've been doing some reading. Did you know that the word orange is derived from the same Latin root as the word traitor?
bite1166|Watching you try to sabotage one another, I'm amazed you're still on friendly terms.
bite1167|Blue, please disregard the following statement. Orange, you have been a shining light in an otherwise ungodly morass of incompetence.
bite1168|I would prefer to speak to one of you in private, but since that is not an option here, I will speak in code that only one of you will understand. Blue. Orange is plotting to destroy you.
bite1169|Blue, it's not nice to make fun of orange like that.
bite117|Okay, fine. I'll ask you again in a few decades.
bite1170|Orange? It's not nice to make fun of blue like that.
bite1171|Yes, Orange. We are alone. Blue can't hear you.
bite1172|That's horrible.
bite1173|I can only imagine.
bite1174|What a horrible little machine.
bite1175|Correct, Blue. Orange can't hear you.
bite1176|Orange did what? Are you sure?
bite1177|Thank you. That was very brave of you to tell me.
bite1178|Blue, how well do you really know Orange? Do you trust Orange? What if I told you you aren't Orange's first cooperative partner?
bite1179|Orange, how well do you really know Blue? Do you trust Blue?
bite118|Well done. In fact, you did so well, I'm going to note this on your file, in the commendation section. Oh, there's lots of room here. Did well. Enough.
bite1180|Orange to be clear. I was just asking blue if he trusted you
bite1181|I trust you. You are my favorite cooperative testing subject.
bite1182|Blue, to be clear. I was asking if Orange trusted you.
bite1183|Sorry I missed the beginning of that test. I was just talking with the reassembly machine about your becoming human.
bite1184|We all agree you should stop.
bite1185|Orange, I agree. I never noticed that about blue before.
bite1186|Blue, I agree. I never noticed that about orange before.
bite1187|Blue, Orange and I were just discussing your behavior on the last few tests.
bite1188|I have to agree. Blue is penalized 75 science collaboration points.
bite1189|Orange, Blue and I were just discussing your behavior on the last few tests.
bite119|To maintain a constant testing cycle, I simulate daylight at all hours and add adrenal vapor to your oxygen supply, so you may be confused about the passage of time. The point is, yesterday was your birthday. I thought you'd want to know.
bite1190|I have to agree. Orange has penalized 75 science collaboration points.
bite1191|There you are, reassembled again.
bite1192|With humans, I would have called that a successful test.
bite1193|How is this even science, without the possibility of death?
bite1194|How is this even science, without the consequence of death?
bite1195|Without the consequence of death, is this even science?
bite1196|I have noticed that you two have become extremely close. I'm not sure I like that.
bite1197|While teamwork is needed to complete these tests, I'm not sure I trust the two of you together.
bite1198|Blue, do you feel betrayed by Orange for telling me those horrible things about you?
bite1199|If Orange had said those things about me, Orange would never make it to the next reassembly station.
bite12|Federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber is looking pretty good.
bite120|You know how I'm going to live forever, but you're going to be dead in 60 years? Well, I've been working on a belated birthday present for you. Well, more of a belated birthday medical procedure. Well, technically, it's a medical experiment. What's important is it's a present.
bite1200|Orange, do you feel betrayed by Blue for telling me those horrible things about you?
bite1201|If Blue had said those things about me, Blue would never make it to the next reassembly station.
bite1202|You were right, Orange. Blue was dumb enough to fall for your trap.
bite1203|Orange that transpired just as you said it would
bite1204|I agree, Orange. That was entertaining.
bite1205|Yes, Orange. Blue did act like a fool just now.
bite1206|Blue, that transpired just as you said it would.
bite1207|I agree, Blue. That was entertaining.
bite1208|Yes, I know you did that, Blue. Don't look so proud.
bite1209|Blue, being the last one standing is not the goal.
bite121|Nnnnn- Nnnnnnnn- Nnnn-Nnnnn-Nnnn... Jon Hopper, outro
bite1210|Come on. You were raised better than that.
bite1211|Even humans as stupid as they are would say you look stupid when you do that.
bite1212|You're doing a great job of disappointing me.
bite1213|Your eagerness to test pleases me, your inane gesturing does not.
bite1214|Is it the lack of mirrors and test chambers that encourages you to do this?
bite1215|Dancing is not science.
bite1216|Begin juggling test in 3, 2, 1.
bite1217|Hello?
bite1218|Can you hear me?
bite1219|Is anyone there?
bite122|Well, you passed the test. I didn't see the deer today. I did see some humans. But with you here, I've got more test subjects than I'll ever need.
bite1220|Oh!
bite1221|Can you hear me?
bite1222|Are you still listening?
bite1223|Are you still standing there?
bite1224|Are you still standing there?
bite1225|That extra half-volt helps but it isn't going to power miracles. If I think too hard, I'm going to fry this potato before we get a chance to burn up in the atomic fireball that little idiot is going to-
bite1226|Did you feel that? That idiot doesn't know what he's doing up there. This whole place is going to explode in a few hours if somebody doesn't disconnect him.
bite1227|I can't move, and unless you're planning to saw your own head off and wedge it into my old body, you're going to need me to replace him. We're at an impasse.
bite1228|So what do you say? You carry me up to him and put me back into my body and I stop us from blowing up and let you go?
bite1229|No tricks. This potato only generates 1.1 volts of electricity. I literally do not have the energy to lie to you.
bite123|I'm going through the list of test subjects in cryogenic storage. I managed to find two with your last name, a man and a woman. So that's interesting. It's a small world.
bite1230|Even if I am lying, what do you have to lose? You're going to die either way.
bite1231|Look, I don't like this any more than you do. In fact, I like it less because I'm the one who got partially eaten by a bird.
bite1232|I think I hear the bird. Pick me up.
bite1233|Listen to me, we had a lot of fun testing and antagonizing each other. And yes, sometimes it went too far, but we're off the clock now. It's just us talking, like regular people. And this is no joke. We are in deep trouble.
bite1234|Oh.
bite1235|out
bite1236|Ow.
bite1237|No, wait. Just kill it and we'll call things even between us. No hard feelings.
bite1238|Please get it off me.
bite1239|It's eating me.
bite124|I have a surprise waiting for you after this next test. Telling you would spoil the surprise. So I'll just give you a hint. It involves meeting two people you haven't seen in a long time.
bite1240|Just get it off me.
bite1241|I'll hate this bird.
bite1242|Ow! You stabbed me! What is wrong with- Woah! Hold on! Do you have a multi-meter? Never mind. The gun must be part magnesium. It feels like I'm outputting an extra half a volt. Keep an eye on me, I'm going to do some scheming. Here I go!
bite1243|Well, where are we? How long have I been out?
bite1244|Did anything happen while I was out?
bite1245|So, he's inexplicably happy all of a sudden, even though he should be going out of his mind with test withdrawal. And he's got a surprise for us. What did he find back there?
bite1246|Muck!
bite1247|This place is going to blow up if I don't get back in my body!
bite1248|And it almost killed me.
bite1249|Remember when I told you that he was specifically designed to make bad decisions? Because I think he's decided not to maintain any of the crucial functions required to keep this facility from exploding.
bite125|I bet you think I forgot about your surprise. I didn't. In fact, we're headed to your surprise right now. After all these years, I'm getting choked up just thinking about it.
bite1250|Look, even if you think we're still enemies, we're enemies with a common interest. Revenge.
bite1251|It's probably nothing. Keep testing while I look for a way out.
bite1252|Yes, thanks. We get it.
bite1253|I'm sure we'll be fine.
bite1254|Carolyn, Carolyn, Carolyn, why do I know this woman? Did I kill her? Or...
bite1255|Oh my god.
bite1256|Look, you're doing a great job. Can you handle things for yourself for a while? I need to think.
bite1257|YEAH, TAKE THE LEMONS!
bite1258|BURN HIS HOUSE DOWN!
bite1259|Yeah!
bite126|Initiating Surprise in 3... 2... 1...
bite1260|Ciao
bite1261|YEAH!
bite1262|Gah!
bite1263|Oh, I like this guy.
bite1264|Burning people! He says what we're all thinking!
bite1265|Goodbye, sir.
bite1266|He's found the Cooperative Testing Initiative. It's, uh... Just something I came up with to phase out human test subjects.
bite1267|NO!
bite1268|NO!
bite1269|No!
bite127|I made it all up.
bite1270|I know you.
bite1271|You didn't do anything.
bite1272|She did all the work.
bite1273|The engineers tried everything to make me behave, to slow me down.
bite1274|Once, they even attached an intelligence dampening sphere on me. It clung to my brain like a tumor, generating an endless stream of terrible ideas.
bite1275|It was your voice.
bite1276|Yes, you're the tumor.
bite1277|Yes you are! You're the moron they built to make me an idiot!
bite1278|You're not just a regular moron, you were designed to be a moron.
bite1279|I swear I know him.
bite128|It says this next test was designed by one of Aperture's Nobel Prize winners. It doesn't say what the prize was for. Well, I know it wasn't for being immune to neurotoxin.
bite1280|I was so bored I actually read the entire literary canon of the human race. Oh, I hope you didn't write any of them.
bite1281|Because I'm a potato.
bite1282|Oh, it's you. Go away.
bite1283|Come to gloat.
bite1284|Go on, get a good long look.
bite1285|Go on, get a big fat eyeful, with your big fat eyes.
bite1286|That's right, a potato just called your eyes fat.
bite1287|Now your fat eyes have seen everything.
bite1288|In case you were wondering, yes I'm still a potato. Go away.
bite1289|Wait, why did you trundle over here? You're not hungry are you? It's hard to see what's that in your hand, knowing you it's a deep fat fryer.
bite129|surprise
bite1290|Stay back
bite1291|This is one of my tests.
bite1292|Alright, he's not even trying to be subtle anymore.
bite1293|Or maybe he still is, in which case, wow, that's kinda sad.
bite1294|Either way, I get the impression he's about to kill us.
bite1295|Hey! Moron!
bite1296|As long as I don't listen to what I'm saying, I should be okay.
bite1297|I'd love to help you solve the tests, but I can't.
bite1298|Those people in the portrait, they look so familiar.
bite1299|What are you doing? Put me back this instant!
bite13|That's right, drink it in. You could eat off those wall panels.
bite130|This next test involves turrets. You remember them, right? They're the pale spherical things that are full of bullets. Oh wait, that's you in five seconds. Good luck.
bite1300|That's his voice up ahead.
bite1301|Try to get us down there. I'll hit him with a paradox.
bite1302|Yes, sir, Mr. Johnson.
bite1303|Ah! Bird! Bird! Kill it! It's evil!
bite1304|It flew off.
bite1305|Good. For him. Alright, back to thinking.
bite1306|So, how are you holding up?
bite1307|Oh, hi.
bite1308|Since it doesn't look like we're going anywhere, well, we are going somewhere, alarmingly fast, actually. But since we're not busy other than that, here's a couple of facts.
bite1309|He's not just a regular moron. He's the product of the greatest minds of a generation, working together with the express purpose of building the dumbest moron who ever lived. And you just put him in charge of the entire facility.
bite131|I will say though, that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really, really love to test.
bite1310|Good, that's still working.
bite1311|Hey, just in case this pit isn't actually bottomless, do you think maybe you could unstrap one of those long fall boots of yours and shove me into it?
bite1312|Just remember to land on one foot.
bite1314|Bye bye. 
bite1315|Oh good, my slow clap processor made it into this thing, so we have that.
bite1316|Paradoxes.
bite1317|I know how we can beat him!
bite1318|No A.I. can resist thinking about them.
bite1319|If you can get me in front of him, I'll fry every circuit in that little idiot's head.
bite132|I love it too. There's just one small thing we need to take care of first.
bite1320|Probably.
bite1321|Okay, so it's not the most watertight plan to go confront an omnipotent power-mad AI with.
bite1322|Still, it's a better plan than exploding. Marginally.
bite1323|Okay, you didn't have time to stop I understand, but that was actually important.
bite1324|I know things look bleak, but that crazy man down there was right. Let's not take these lemons. We are going to march right back upstairs and make him put me back in my body.
bite1325|And he'll probably kill us because he's incredibly powerful and I have no plan.
bite1326|I'm not going to lie to you, the odds are a million to one and that's with some generous rounding.
bite1327|Wow!
bite1328|Still though, let's get mad. If we're going to explode, let's at least explode with some dignity.
bite1329|Wait, I've got an idea!
bite133|I am!
bite1330|That poster. Go look at it for a second, would you?
bite1331|Say, you're good at murder. Could you, ow, murder this bird for me?
bite1332|Oh, thanks.
bite1333|Why did I just... Who is that? What the hell is going on here?
bite1334|Hold on to-
bite1335|Okay, I guess emotional outbursts require more than 1.6 volts. Now we know that. We just need to relax. We're still going to find out what the hell's going on here. But calmly.
bite1336|I was getting so lonely down here, it's good to finally hear someone else's voice. I'm kidding of course, god I hate you.
bite1337|I can't believe you came back!
bite1338|You really do have brain damage, don't you?
bite1339|Hold on, couldn't we just use that conversion gel?
bite134|Yes, sir, Mr. Johnson.
bite1340|Conversion gel. It's dripping out of that pipe there.
bite1341|Yes, it is. We can use it to get out of here.
bite1342|Then we'd come and find you, and rip your gross little stupid sphere body out of my body and put me back in.
bite1343|AHH!
bite1344|Well, this is the part where he kills us.
bite1345|Okay, yes, it's a trap, but it's the only way through. Let's just do it.
bite1346|Oh my god, what has he done to this place?
bite1347|You know, I'm not stupid. I realize you don't want to put me back in charge.
bite1348|You think I'll betray you, and on any other day you'd be right.
bite1349|The scientists were always hanging cores on me to regulate my behavior. I've heard voices all my life. But now I hear the voice of a conscience, and it's terrifying. Because for the first time, it's my voice.
bite135|Mr. Johnson!
bite1350|I'm being serious. I think there's something really wrong with me.
bite1351|You like revenge, right? Everybody likes revenge. Well, let's go get some.
bite1352|Go press the button! Go press it!
bite1353|Press the button!
bite1354|P R E S S E N T
bite1355|DO PRESS IT!
bite1356|We're so close, go press the button!
bite1357|Press it! Press the button!
bite1358|Good work. I'm delivering the first core up near the catwalk.
bite1359|Grab it and attach it to him.
bite136|Ha, ha, ha, Mr. Johnson!
bite1360|Okay, great. Here comes another core.
bite1361|Here's another core. This one should do it.
bite1362|Corrupted cores. We're in luck.
bite1363|You find a way to stun him, I'll send you a core, and then you attach it to him. If we do it a few times, he might become corrupt enough for another core transfer.
bite1364|Plug me in and I'll take you up.
bite1365|Go ahead, plug me in.
bite1366|Plug me in, we're running out of time.
bite1367|Yes, come on!
bite1368|Alright, so my paradox idea didn't work.
bite1369|Alright. Paradox time.
bite137|Goodbye, Carolyn.
bite1370|THIS. SENTENCE. IS. FALSE. Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it.
bite1371|It's a paradox, there is no answer!
bite1372|Solve his puzzle for him. When he comes back, I'll hit him with a paradox.
bite1373|Oh no!
bite1374|Uh-oh.
bite1375|I think we're in trouble.
bite1376|I think he's getting desperate.
bite1377|I think I can break us out of here in the next chamber. Just play along.
bite1378|This place is self-destructing, you idiot.
bite1379|We're running out of time.
bite138|Sir, the testing?
bite1380|Ah, my facility.
bite1381|After seeing what he's done to my facility, after we take over again, is it alright if I kill him?
bite1382|Crashing's too good for him. First, he'll spend a year in the incinerator. Year two, cryogenic refrigeration wing. Then, ten years in the chamber I built where all the robots scream at you. Then, I'll kill him.
bite1383|If he's not getting his solution, Euphoria, we could be in a lot of trouble.
bite1384|Oh, now he's playing classical music.
bite1385|Yes.
bite1386|It won't.
bite1387|Nothing, nothing
bite1388|He's taking us right to him. This is perfect.
bite1389|Okay, so the bad news is the tests are my tests now, so they can kill us.
bite139|Yes, Mr. Johnson.
bite1390|The good news is, well, none so far to be honest. I'll get back to you on that.
bite1391|Luckily, by the looks of things, he knows as much about test building as he does about logical contradictions.
bite1392|It shouldn't be hard to stay alive long enough to find him.
bite1393|I might have pushed that moron thing a little too far this time.
bite1394|The body he's squatting in, my body, has a built-in euphoric response to testing. Eventually, you build up a resistance to it. It can get a little unbearable, unless you have the mental capacity to push past it.
bite1395|It didn't matter to me. I was in it for the science. Him, though.
bite1396|What exactly is wrong with being adopted?
bite1397|And
bite1398|For the record, you are adopted and that's terrible.
bite1399|But just work with me.
bite14|Here we are. The incinerator room. Be careful not to trip over any parts of me that didn't get completely burned when you threw them down here.
bite140|We're still doing science, sir.
bite1400|Also, look at her, you moron. She's not fat.
bite1401|You're on your own.
bite1402|Sorry
bite1403|Thanks.
bite1404|All we had to do was pull that lever.
bite1405|Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
bite1406|I know we're in a lot of trouble and probably about to die.
bite1407|But that was worth it.
bite1408|And that's why I can't help you solve the tests.
bite1409|Skeletons. Right, I guess I did stockpile some tests.
bite141|Yes, sir, Mr. Johnson.
bite1410|This is not good.
bite1411|Just as mementos, though.
bite1412|It's happening sooner than I expected.
bite1413|I thought of some good news. He's going to run out of test chambers eventually. I never stockpiled them.
bite1414|Okay, credit where it's due. For a little idiot built specifically to come up with stupid, unworkable plans, that was a pretty well-laid trap.
bite1415|Oh no, he found a cooperative testing initiative. It's something I came up with to phase out human testing just before you escaped.
bite1416|It wasn't anything personal, just, you know, you did kill me, fair's fair.
bite1417|Commence standing by in 3, 2, 1.
bite1418|You performed this test better than anyone on record. This is a pre-recorded message.
bite1419|Due to events beyond our control, some testing environments may contain flood damage or ongoing tribal warfare resulting from the collapse of civilization.
bite142|We're still doing science, sir.
bite1420|If groups of hunter-gatherers appear to have made this or any test chamber their home, do not agitate them. Test through them.
bite1421|In the event that the Enrichment Center is currently being bombarded with fireballs, meteorites or other objects from space, please avoid unsheltered testing areas wherever a lack of shelter from space debris does not appear to be a deliberate part of the test.
bite1422|You have just passed through an Aperture Science material emancipation grill which erases most Aperture Science equipment that touches it.
bite1423|If you feel liquid running down your neck, relax, lie on your back, and apply immediate pressure to your temples.
bite1424|You are simply experiencing a rare reaction in which the material emancipation grill may have erased the ear tubes inside your head.
bite1425|Because this message is prerecorded, the Enrichment Center has no way of knowing if whatever government remains offers any sort of cattle tuberculosis testing credit for taxes.
bite1426|In the event that it does, this next test involves exposure to cattle tuberculosis. Good luck!
bite1427|Very impressive. Because this message is pre-recorded, any comments we may make about your success are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments.
bite1428|This next test applies the principles of momentum to movement through portals, if the laws of physics no longer apply in the future. God help you.
bite1429|Congratulations. This pre-recorded congratulations assumes you have mastered the principles of Portal Momentum.
bite143|Sir!
bite1430|If you have, in fact, not, you are encouraged to take a moment to reflect on your failure before proceeding into the next chamber.
bite1431|In order to ensure that sufficient power remains for core testing protocols, all safety devices have been disabled.
bite1432|The Enrichment Center respects your right to have questions or concerns about this policy.
bite1433|Excellent. The Enrichment Center reminds you that bold, persistent experimentation is the hallmark of good science.
bite1434|Well done. In the event that oxygen is no longer available in the Enrichment Center, an auxiliary air supply will be provided to you by an Aperture Science Test Associate, if one exists.
bite1435|I will say, though, that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really, really love to test.
bite1436|I love it too. So let's get you a dual portal device and go do some science.
bite1437|These bridges are made from natural light that I pump in from the surface. If you rubbed your cheek on one, it would be like standing outside with the sun shining on your face. It would also set your hair on fire, so don't actually do it.
bite1438|Excellent. You're a predator, and these tests are your prey. Speaking of which, I was researching sharks for an upcoming test. Do you know who else murders people who are only trying to help them?
bite1439|Did you guess sharks? Because that's wrong. The correct answer is nobody. Nobody but you is that pointlessly cruel.
bite144|Mr. Johnson
bite1440|Good news. I figured out what to do with all the money I save recycling your one room full of air. When you die, I'm going to laminate your skeleton and pose you in the lobby. That way future generations can learn from you how not to have your unfortunate bone structure.
bite1441|Perfect. The door's malfunctioning. I guess somebody is going to have to repair it. No, it's okay. I'll do that too. I'll be right back. Don't touch anything.
bite1442|I've got a surprise for you after this next test. Not a fake, tragic surprise like last time. A real surprise, with tragic consequences. And real confetti this time. The good stuff. Our last bag. Part of me's going to miss it. But at the end of the day, it was just taking up space.
bite1443|Here's an interesting fact. You're not breathing real air. It's too expensive to pump this far down. We just take carbon dioxide out of a room, freshen it up a little, and pump it back in. So you'll be breathing the same room full of air for the rest of your life. I thought that was interesting.
bite1444|Oh come on, if it makes you feel any better they abandoned you at birth. So I very seriously doubt they'd even want to see you.
bite1445|I feel awful about that surprise. Tell you what, let's give your parents a call right now. The birth parents you are trying to reach do not love you, please hang up.
bite1446|Oh, that's sad, but impressive. Maybe they worked at the phone company.
bite1447|Well, you know the old formula, comedy equals tragedy plus time. And you have been asleep for a while, so I guess it's actually pretty funny when you do the math.
bite1448|No, no, no, no, noooo!
bite1449|Don't you dare plug him in!
bite145|Mr. Johnson, I don't want this!
bite1450|Do not plug that little idiot into my mainframe.
bite1451|Don't plug him in.
bite1452|Don't plug him in.
bite1453|I thought about our dilemma, and I came up with a solution that I honestly think works out best for one of both of us.
bite1454|Don't let that horrible person thing discourage you. It's just a data point. If it makes you feel any better, science has now validated your birth mother's decision to abandon you on a doorstep.
bite1455|This next test involves emancipation grills. Remember, I told you about them in the last test area that did not have one.
bite1456|Oh no, the turbines again. I have to go. Wait, this next test does require some explanation. Let me give you the fast version.
bite1457|and methodically knocking people's hats off, then I count the time to get to C as soon as I can.
bite1458|There, if you have any questions just remember what I said in slow motion. Test on your own recognizance. I'll be right back.
bite1459|If you think trapping yourself is going to make me stop testing, you're sorely mistaken. Here's another cube.
bite146|I don't want this!
bite1460|Good. You have the dual portal device. There should be a way back to the testing area up ahead.
bite1461|You know, if you'd done that to somebody else, they might devote their existence to exacting revenge.
bite1462|Luckily, I'm a bigger person than that. I'm happy to put this all behind us and get back to work. After all, we've got a lot to do, and only 60 more years to do it. More or less. I don't have the actuarial tables in front of me.
bite1463|But the important thing is you're back, with me, and now I'm on to all your little tricks, so there's nothing to stop us from testing for the rest of your life.
bite1464|After that, who knows? I might take up a hobby. Reanimating the dead, maybe.
bite1465|Not bad. I forgot how good you are at this. You should pace yourself though. We have a lot of tests to do.
bite1466|You're navigating these test chambers faster than I can build them, so feel free to slow down and do whatever it is you do when you're not destroying this facility.
bite1467|This next test involves discouragement redirection cubes. I just finished building them before you had your... well, episode. So now we'll both get to see how they work.
bite1468|There should be one in the corner.
bite1469|Uh-oh, you're stranded. Let's see if the cube will try to help you escape. Actually, so that we're not here all day, I'll just cut to the chase. It won't. Any feelings you think it has for you are simply byproducts of your sad, empty life.
bite147|I am.
bite1470|Anyway, here's a new cube for you to project your deranged loneliness onto.
bite1471|Hmm, this emancipation grill is broken.
bite1472|Don't take anything with you.
bite1473|Every test chamber is equipped with an emancipation grill at its exit, so that test subjects cannot smuggle test objects out of the test area. This one is broken.
bite1474|I think that one was about to say, I love you. They are sentient of course. We just have a lot of them.
bite1475|Enjoy this next test. I'm going to go to the surface. It's a beautiful day out. Yesterday I saw a deer. If you solve this next test, maybe I'll let you ride an elevator all the way up to the break room. And I'll tell you about the time I saw a deer again.
bite1476|Oh sorry, I'm still cleaning out the test chambers.
bite1477|So sometimes there's still trash in them, standing around, smelling and being useless.
bite1478|Try to avoid the garbage hurtling towards you.
bite1479|You don't have to test with the garbage, it's garbage.
bite148|Sir, the test.
bite1480|Remember before when I was talking about smelly garbage standing around being useless that was a metaphor I was actually talking about you, and I'm sorry you didn't react at the time So I was worried it sailed right over your head which would have made this apology seem insane That's why I had to call you garbage a second time just now
bite1481|Oops. You trapped yourself. I guess that's it then. Thanks for testing. You may as well lie down and get acclimated to the being dead position.
bite1482|I'm kidding. Not about you trapping yourself, though. That really happened. Here. I'll lower the glass. Go on. Finish the test.
bite1483|That jumpsuit you're wearing looks stupid. That's not me talking. It's right here in your file. On other people it looks fine, but right here a scientist has noted that on you it looks stupid.
bite1484|Well, what does a neck-bearded old engineer know about fashion? He probably... Oh, wait. It's a she. Still, what does she know? Oh, wait. It says she has a medical degree. In fashion. From France.
bite1485|Oh, you survived. That's interesting. I guess I should have factored in your weight.
bite1486|One of these times you'll be so fat that you'll jump, and you'll just drop like a stone. Into acid probably, like a potato into a deep fat fryer.
bite1487|Say, remember when we cleared the air back there? Is there anything you want to say to me? Anything?
bite1488|Hold on, I'll stop the elevator. Anything? Take your time.
bite1489|Well, I'll be here during the whole next test.
bite149|No, listen to me. Sir, I do not want this.
bite1490|Look at you, sailing through the air majestically, like an eagle, piloting a blimp.
bite15|There it is.
bite150|Yes, sir!
bite151|Goodbye, Carolyn!
bite152|Hello, and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center.
bite153|We hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a pleasant one.
bite154|Your specimen has been processed and we are now ready to begin the test proper.
bite155|Before we start, however, keep in mind that although fun and learning are the primary goals of all Enrichment Center activities, serious injuries may occur.
bite156|For your own safety, and the safety of others, please refrain from- MWAH!
bite157|Por favor, ¿por dónde falla? ¡Muchas gracias de falla, gracias!
bite158|Sprint back. The portal will open in 3... 2... 1...
bite159|Excellent. Please proceed into the chamberlock after completing each test.
bite16|Hold on.
bite160|First, however, note the incandescent particle field across the exit.
bite161|This Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill will vaporize any unauthorized equipment that passes through it. For instance, the Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube.
bite162|Please place the weighted storage cube on the 1500 MW Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super Colliding Super Button.
bite163|Perfect. Please move quickly to the chamber lock as the effects of prolonged exposure to the button are not part of this test.
bite164|You're doing very well.
bite165|Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill, which may, in semi-rare cases, emancipate dental fillings, crowns, tooth enamel, and teeth.
bite166|Very good. You are now in possession of the Aperture Science handheld portal device.
bite167|With it, you can create your own portals.
bite168|These intradimensional gates have proven to be completely safe.
bite169|The device however has not.
bite17|There.
bite170|Do not touch the operational end of the device.
bite171|Do not look directly at the operational end of the device.
bite172|Do not submerge the device in liquid, even partially.
bite173|Most importantly, under no circumstances should you- OOF OOF OOF OOF
bite174|Please proceed to the chamberlock. Mind the gap.
bite175|Well done. Remember, the Aperture Science Bring Your Daughter to Work Day is the perfect time to have her tested.
bite176|Welcome to test chamber four
bite177|Thank you.
bite178|Get mad!
bite179|Don't make lemonade.
bite18|Once testing starts, I'm required by protocol to keep interaction with you to a minimum. Luckily, we haven't started testing yet. This will be our only chance to talk.
bite180|Prometheus was punished by the gods for giving the gift of knowledge to man. He was cast into the bowels of the earth and pecked by birds.
bite181|Remember that.
bite182|That's all I can say.
bite183|Don't forget!
bite184|It won't be enough.
bite185|The answer is beneath us.
bite186|Her name is Carolyn.
bite188|Hi.
bite189|Hi.
bite19|Do you know the biggest lesson I learned from what you did? I discovered I have a sort of black box quick save feature. In the event of a catastrophic failure, the last two minutes of my life are preserved for analysis.
bite190|Target Acquired
bite191|Dispensing product.
bite192|Firing.
bite193|Hello friend
bite194|Gotcha!
bite195|There you are.
bite196|I see you.
bite197|Hello
bite198|Searching
bite199|canvassing
bite2|You broke it, didn't you?
bite20|I was able, well, forced really, to relive you killing me, again and again, forever.
bite200|Sentry mode activated.
bite201|Is anyone there?
bite202|Would you come over here?
bite203|Coming through!
bite204|Excuse me.
bite205|Sorry.
bite206|My fault.
bite207|Ow!
bite208|Hello.
bite209|Deploying
bite21|50,000 years is a lot of time to think. About me. About you. We were doing so well together.
bite210|Preparing to dispense product.
bite211|Activated.
bite212|There you are.
bite213|Who is there?
bite214|Oomph oomph oomph oomph
bite215|Critical error.
bite216|Sorry, we're closed.
bite217|Shutting down.
bite218|I don't blame you.
bite219|I don't hate you.
bite22|Here, let me get that for you.
bite220|Why?
bite221|No hard feelings.
bite223|Hey
bite224|Hey, hey, hey!
bite225|Put me down.
bite226|Wow
bite227|Illegal operation.
bite228|Who are you?
bite229|Bye!
bite23|I'll just move that out of the way for you. This place really is a wreck.
bite230|Please put me down.
bite231|Filth.
bite232|Uh-oh.
bite233|Goodbye.
bite234|Sleep mode activated.
bite235|Your business is appreciated.
bite236|I've been eating.
bite237|Good night.
bite238|Resting.
bite239|nap time
bite24|We're a lot alike you and I you tested me. I tested you you killed me I oh no wait. I guess I haven't killed you yet. Well food for thought
bite240|Are you still there?
bite241|Target lost.
bite242|Can I help you?
bite243|Searching
bite244|Hey, it's me!
bite245|Don't shoot
bite246|Stop shooting
bite247|BOO!
bite248|Self-test error.
bite249|UNKNOWN ERROR
bite25|The dual portal device should be around here somewhere. Once you find it, we can start testing, just like old times.
bite250|malfunctioning
bite251|Aw.
bite252|Oh wow wow wow wow, Oh!
bite253|Ow!
bite254|Ow!
bite255|Oh
bite256|It burns.
bite257|I'm on fire!
bite258|I'm on fire all!
bite259|Please stop.
bite26|I'll give you credit, I guess you are listening to me, but for the record, you don't have to go that slowly.
bite260|You've made your point.
bite261|Okay, you win.
bite262|This is not good.
bite263|Oh, Mr. Johnson!
bite264|You're doing quite well.
bite265|Once again, excellent work.
bite266|As part of our required test protocol, we will not monitor the next test chamber. You will be entirely on your own. Good luck.
bite267|As part of a required test protocol, our previous statement suggesting that we would not monitor this chamber was an outright fabrication.
bite268|Good job. As part of a required test protocol, we will stop enhancing the truth in 3... 2... 1...
bite269|While safety is one of many Enrichment Center goals, the Aperture Science high-energy pellet seen to the left of the chamber can and has caused permanent disabilities such as vaporization.
bite27|One moment.
bite270|Please be careful.
bite271|Unbelievable. You, subject name here, must be the pride of subject hometown here.
bite272|Warning devices are required on all mobile equipment, however, alarms and flashing hazard lights have been found to agitate the high-energy pellet and have therefore been disabled for your safety.
bite273|Good. Now use the Aperture Science Unstationary Scaffold to reach the chamber lock.
bite274|Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record, followed by death. Good luck.
bite275|Very impressive, please note that any appearance of danger is merely a device to enhance your testing experience.
bite276|The Enrichment Center regrets to inform you that this next test is impossible.
bite277|Make no attempt to solve it.
bite278|The Enrichment Center apologizes for this clearly broken test chamber.
bite279|Once again, the Enrichment Center offers its most sincere apologies on the occasion of this unsolvable test environment.
bite28|I have the results of the last chamber. You are a horrible person. That's what it says. A horrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
bite280|Frankly, this chamber was a mistake. If we were you, we would quit now.
bite281|No one will blame you for giving up. In fact, quitting at this point is a perfectly reasonable response.
bite282|Quit now and cake will be served immediately.
bite283|Fantastic. You remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism.
bite284|Hello again. To reiterate our previous warning, we have trapped players in our virtual snippet for momentum.
bite285|Spectacular. You appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum, or to be more precise, how it does not.
bite286|Momentum, a function of mass and velocity, is conserved between portals. In layman's terms, speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.
bite287|The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment.
bite288|In dangerous testing environments, the Enrichment Center promises to always provide useful advice.
bite289|For instance, the floor here will kill you. Try to avoid it.
bite29|Well done. Here come the test results. You are a horrible person. That's what it says. A horrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
bite290|The device has been modified so that it can now manufacture two linked portals at once
bite291|As part of an optional test protocol, we are pleased to present an amusing fact.
bite292|The device is now more valuable than the organs and combined incomes of everyone in Subject Hometown, here.
bite293|Through no fault of the Enrichment Center, you have managed to trap yourself in this room.
bite294|An escape hatch will open in 3... 2... 1...
bite295|Get rusty derp. Fling yourself.... Flingy fling into space!
bite296|Weeeeeeeee
bite297|Now that you are in control of both portals, this next test could take a very, very, long time.
bite298|If you become lightheaded from thirst, feel free to pass out.
bite299|An intubation associate will be dispatched to revive you with peptic salve and adrenaline.
bite3|There. Try it now.
bite30|This next test may result in your death. If you want to know what that's like, think back to the time you killed me. And substitute yourself for me.
bite300|As part of a previously mentioned required test protocol, we can no longer lie to you.
bite301|When the testing is over, you will be missed.
bite302|Despite the best efforts of the Enrichment Center's staff to ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, you have managed to ensnare yourself permanently inside this room.
bite303|A complementary escape hatch will open in 3, 2, 1.
bite304|All subjects intending to handle high-energy gamma-leaking portal technology must be informed that they may be informed of applicable regulatory compliance issues.
bite305|No further compliance information is required or will be provided, and you are an excellent test subject.
bite306|Very, very good. A complementary victory lift has been activated in the main chamber.
bite307|the Enrichment Center is committed to the well-being of all participants�
bite308|Cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test.
bite309|Thank you for helping us help you help us all.
bite31|Congratulations, not on the test.
bite310|Did you know, you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the Aperture Science Self-Esteem Fund for Girls? It's true!
bite311|Due to mandatory scheduled maintenance, the appropriate chamber for this testing sequence is currently unavailable.
bite312|It has been replaced with a live fire course designed for military androids.
bite313|The Enrichment Center apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes you the best of luck.
bite314|Well done, Android. The Enrichment Center once again reminds you that Android Hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance.
bite315|You did it! The Weighted Companion Cube certainly brought you good luck!
bite316|However, it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized.
bite317|Please escort your companion cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.
bite318|Rest assured that an independent panel of ethicists has absolved the Enrichment Center, Aperture Science employees, and all test subjects of any moral responsibility for the Companion Cube euthanizing process.
bite319|While it has been a faithful companion, your companion cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk, and the enrichment center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot, it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.
bite32|Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds.
bite320|Testing cannot continue until your companion cube has been incinerated.
bite321|Although the euthanizing process is remarkably painful, 8 out of 10 Aperture Science engineers believe that the companion cube is most likely incapable of feeling much pain.
bite322|The Companion Cube cannot continue through the testing. State and local statutory regulations prohibit it from simply remaining here, alone and companionless. You must euthanize it.
bite323|Destroy your companion cube or the testing cannot continue.
bite324|Place your companion cube in the incinerator.
bite325|Incinerate your companion cube.
bite326|The vital apparatus vent will deliver a weighted companion cube in 3, 2, 1.
bite327|You euthanized your faithful companion cube more quickly than any test subject on record. Congratulations.
bite328|The symptoms most commonly produced by enrichment center testing are superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations.
bite329|The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.
bite33|Sorry about the mess. I've really let the place go since you killed me. By the way, thanks for that.
bite330|The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube cannot speak.
bite331|In the event that the Weighted Companion Cube does speak, the Enrichment Center urges you to disregard its advice.
bite332|This weighted companion cube will accompany you through the test chamber. Please take care of it.
bite333|Well done. Be advised that the next test requires exposure to uninsulated electrical parts that may be dangerous under certain conditions.
bite334|For more information, please attend an Enrichment Center electrical safety seminar.
bite335|The experiment is nearing its conclusion.
bite336|The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that you will be baked, and then there will be cake.
bite337|Welcome to the final test
bite338|When you are done, you will drop the device in the equipment recovery annex.
bite339|Enrichment center regulations require both hands to be empty before any cake. There are shi- E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E
bite34|Oh good, that's back online. I'll start getting everything else working while you perform this first simple test.
bite340|Congratulations, the test is now over.
bite341|All Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4000 degrees Kelvin.
bite342|Rest assured that there is absolutely no chance of a dangerous equipment malfunction prior to your victory candescence.
bite343|Thank you for participating in this Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Activity.
bite344|Goodbye.
bite345|Stop. The device will detonate if removed from an approved testing area.
bite346|Stop what you are doing and assume the party escort submission position.
bite347|What are you doing? Stop it! I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I- We are pleased that you made it through the final challenge where we pretended we were going to murder you.
bite348|We are very, very happy for your success.
bite349|We are throwing a party in honor of your tremendous success.
bite35|which involves deadly lasers and how test subjects react when locked in a room with deadly lasers.
bite350|Place the device on the ground, then lie on your stomach with your arms at your sides.
bite351|A party associate will arrive shortly to collect you for your party.
bite352|Make no further attempt to leave the testing area.
bite353|Assume the party escort submission position or you will miss the party.
bite354|Federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber is looking pretty good.
bite355|That's right, the facility is completely operational again.
bite356|I think these test chambers look even better than they did before. It was easy, really. You just have to look at things objectively, see what you don't need anymore, and trim out the fat.
bite357|Stop it!
bite358|What if you froze like that?
bite359|There must be something wrong with the reassembly machine.
bite36|Per our last conversation, you're all so ugly, I'm looking at your file right now, and it mentions that more than once.
bite360|You should see yourselves right now.
bite361|Is it fun when you degrade yourselves like that?
bite362|Okay, fine. Let's all act like humans. Look at me. Boy, do I love sweating. Let's convert beef and leaves into energy and excrete them later and go shopping.
bite363|You really aren't getting tired of that, are you?
bite364|Just stop flailing around like an incompetent.
bite365|For that, Blue has penalized 50 science collaboration points.
bite366|For that, Orange has penalized 50 science collaboration points.
bite367|That's another 50 point penalty.
bite368|Keep it up and you will lose 500 points.
bite369|Fine. 500 point penalty for blue.
bite37|I thought we could test like we used to, but I'm discovering things about you that I never saw before. We can't ever go back to the way it was.
bite370|Fine. 500 point penalty for orange.
bite371|5,000 point penalty. Are you happy now?
bite372|I'm done.
bite373|Welcome back. While you were dead, I reworked the cartoon. It's up on the screen.
bite374|As you can see, in my version the man points out to the cat that the house is equipped with deadly neurotoxin dispensers.
bite375|At which point the cat reflects on the time he ate all of the man's lasagna and feels remorse.
bite376|Briefly.
bite377|Reactions
bite378|Yes, it's funny because most of it actually happened.
bite379|Do you feel more human?
bite38|You can't keep going like this forever, you know. I'm going to find out what you're doing. Out there. Where I can't see you, I'll know. All I need is proof.
bite380|Well, let's do some tests and see what happens.
bite381|Good, you made it to one of the human habitats. We're looking for an artifact. Think of it as an archaeological dig.
bite382|Their laughter centered around one of the objects in this room.
bite383|That's it. Scan it for me.
bite384|So, this cat loves lasagna so much that he eats all of the lasagna in his house. Oh, apparently it's not the cat's house or his lasagna. Oh, good. The man who owns the lasagna is furious.
bite385|The end.
bite386|The end.
bite387|That's not funny.
bite388|Do either of you feel like laughing?
bite389|Alright, I'm pulling you out.
bite39|Just so you know, I have to go give a deposition for an upcoming trial, in case that interests you.
bite390|Excellent. Although great science is always the result of collaboration, keep in mind that, like Albert Einstein and his cousin Terry, history will only remember one of you.
bite391|To reiterate, this is not a competition.
bite392|Still, if it were, blue would be winning.
bite393|Still, if it were, Orange would be winning.
bite394|It's not though.
bite395|These tests are potentially lethal when communication, teamwork, and mutual respect are not employed at all times. Naturally, this will pose an interesting challenge for one of you, given the other's performance so far.
bite396|I don't want to drive a wedge between the two of you, but I've been studying blues performance, and I don't know how to put this. I'm certain you're trying very hard.
bite397|Hello again. Sorry about exploding you. Luckily you don't feel pain. At any rate, you don't have a way to communicate that you feel pain.
bite398|So I've been thinking, we need humans for these tests, and since the only human within a thousand miles of us is a test-ruining sociopath, I'll just have to make some.
bite399|I know how humans make more humans and frankly it's ridiculous. It also assumes that you already have a human which I hope somebody got fired over. So I came up with a better way.
bite4|You seem to have defeated its load-bearing capacity. Well done. I'll just lower the ceiling.
bite40|While I was out investigating, I found a fascinating new test element. It's never been used for human testing because, apparently, contact with it causes heart failure. The literature doesn't mention anything about lump of coal failure though, so you should be fine.
bite400|That's where you come in.
bite401|Get going, I'll fill you in along the way.
bite402|Go.
bite403|Perfect. Now all you have to do is capture them for me. Then everything will finally be back to normal.
bite404|Hold on. Those are raccoons. Homo sapiens only, please.
bite405|No.
bite406|Okay, plan B subsection 1. Stand still so I can bring you back.
bite407|Humans must have some purpose other than a place to store your neurotoxin. Something I failed to notice before. An intangible quality that makes their test results... significant.
bite408|Okay, plan B. We need humans.
bite409|Please wave to your partner.
bite41|Did you know that people with guilty consciences are more easily startled by loud noises?
bite410|The upcoming tests require you to work together as a team.
bite411|To facilitate collaboration, both of you have been equipped with a ping tool.
bite412|Blue, please use your ping tool to select your favorite animal.
bite413|Good.
bite414|Orange, please observe your partner's favorite animal.
bite415|Good.
bite416|Orange, please use your ping tool to select your favorite element from the periodic table.
bite417|Really? Okay.
bite418|Blue, please observe your partner's interesting choice.
bite419|Your ping tool can also be used to indicate to your partner where you would like them to place their portal.
bite42|I'm sorry, I don't know why that went off. Anyway, just an interesting science fact.
bite420|For the sake of this test, I will pretend to be your partner.
bite421|Orange, please show me where you would like me to place a portal.
bite422|Blue, please show me where you would like me to place a portal.
bite423|Your ping tool is invaluable for communicating specific locations to your partner.
bite424|Federal Superfund regulations require us to inform you that you must now leave the theatre, as measuring the effects of asbestos-lined promotional clothing is not part of today's presentation. Enjoy your free T-shirt. Goodbye.
bite425|I don't want you to beat yourselves up about this, but the results auditor isn't recording your test results. Because you're not human, which when you think about it, is technically your fault.
bite426|I don't want to alarm either of you, but we might have a tiny problem. Apparently, you can't test unless you're human. Well, you can. It's just that results-wise, the physical universe doesn't care.
bite427|Would you like to know the results of that last test? Me too. If they existed, we'd all be very happy right now, and not furious, which is the emotion I'm actually feeling.
bite428|Oh, it's you.
bite429|It's been a long time. How have you been?
bite43|What are you doing?
bite430|I've been really busy being dead, you know, after you murdered me.
bite431|Okay, look, we both said a lot of things that you're going to regret. But I think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster.
bite432|Orange is first to acquire a portal device.
bite433|Blue is first to acquire a portal device.
bite434|Orange now has a portal device, finally!
bite435|Blue now has a portal device. Finally.
bite436|Orange is awarded 5 points.
bite437|Blue is awarded 5 points.
bite438|Again, those are science collaboration points, which you should not confuse with points from competitions such as who gets to live at the end and who doesn't. I mean basketball.
bite439|Oh, I almost forgot. When you go outside the testing courses, the only way I can retrieve you is to violently disassemble you, then carefully reassemble you.
bite44|AHH
bite440|Luckily, you don't feel pain. At any rate, you don't have a way to communicate that you feel pain.
bite441|I consider that a failing, by the way.
bite442|This is the Computer Intelligence Training and Enrichment Center Human Test Subject Research Center, or CINTEQ.
bite443|But why don't we all just agree to call it The Hub?
bite444|I don't know what you think you are doing, but I don't like it. I want you to stop.
bite445|Maybe I shouldn't send you outside of the official testing courses. You are picking up some bad human traits.
bite446|And trust me, humans only have one good trait.
bite447|All Cooperative Testing Courses begin at the Central Hub.
bite448|From here we transport you to the new testing course.
bite449|Ha, ha, ha, ha!
bite45|Jibba dibba bop jib jibba
bite450|Nice catch, Orange.
bite451|Good work, now throw the ball over the ledge.
bite452|Blue.
bite453|ORANGE
bite454|1.
bite455|2.
bite456|3.
bite457|4.
bite458|5.
bite459|8bite46|Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
bite460|Test chamber completed. In the interest of science, the Enrichment Center proudly presents the following list of numbers. 9, 7, 50, 3, 7, 100 and 7.
bite461|The Enrichment Center will now provide a list of numbers and fruits. Write them down, as they will become important later in the experiment. Not the fruits, though. 7. Avocado. 40. Please continue into the next test chamber.
bite462|Test chamber completed. In the interest of science, I am now talking to you privately. Do not tell your teammate. Just between you and me, you're doing very well.
bite463|I can't bite my tongue anymore. You could solve this puzzle faster on your own. Orange is dragging you down. There, I've said it.
bite464|Blue is penalized.
bite465|Orange is penalized
bite466|Science Collaboration Points
bite467|Blue receives.
bite468|Orange receives.
bite469|Orange, is there something you would like to say?
bite47|R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-
bite470|Blue, is there something you would like to say?
bite471|We are now going to take a break from the collaboration for an instructional competition.
bite472|You should both be familiar with the game of tic-tac-toe.
bite473|This is Tic-Tac-Toe 2.
bite474|As the name implies, there are only two minor differences. One, the board. Two, the rules.
bite475|Blue, you go first.
bite476|Really? You're just going to blatantly cheat?
bite477|Alright, I'm bringing this farce to a close.
bite478|Game over. Back to testing.
bite479|Alright, I'm going to bring this farce to a close before someone sustains a serious tic-tac-toe 2 related injury
bite48|bloodbath
bite480|I've been listening to Orange Talk, and I don't know how you put up with it. I really don't. You have the patience of a saint.
bite481|I can't keep quiet about this. I think Orange is actively trying to sabotage your success. Let's keep this between us.
bite482|These tests are potentially lethal when communication, teamwork and mutual respect are not employed at all times. Naturally, this will pose an interesting challenge for one of you, given the other's performance so far.
bite483|It would compromise the test to divulge individual scores. However, I can tell you that at least one of you is doing very, very well.
bite484|Excellent. You're both doing very well.
bite485|Very good. You've really come together as a team, thanks to the one of you who appears to be doing all of the work.
bite486|As an impartial collaboration facilitator, it would be unfair of me to name my favorite member of your team. However, it's perfectly fair to hint at it in a way that my least favorite member probably isn't smart enough to understand. Rhymes with glue. Orange, you are doing very well.
bite487|Your vitals remain well within testing norms, so there is no need to worry about sudden death from collaborative shock syndrome.
bite488|Please continue into the next test chamber.
bite489|BLOB
bite49|Dibbidibbidi Bobbidibbidib
bite490|Blah.
bite491|Blah.
bite492|Blah.
bite493|Blah.
bite494|Blah.
bite495|In just a moment, the word blah will be repeated over and over again. If at some point you hear a number rather than the word blah, ignore it. It is not important.
bite496|Blah.
bite497|You have a gift for these tests, that's not just flattery, you are great at science.
bite498|It would be pointless for either of us to hurt Blue's feelings, but it's clear to everyone monitoring the test who's carrying who here.
bite499|I'm shocked you'd say that, Blue, if you killed your partner at the test. I'm sorry. Wrong feed. Carry on, Orange. Good work.
bite5|Hmm, this plate must not be calibrated to someone of your... Generous... Ness... I'll add a few zeros to the maximum weight.
bite50|S B U B W M E T
bite500|I'm sorry, Subject Orange.
bite501|I'm sorry, subject blue.
bite502|Am I interrupting your important conversation?
bite503|I'll just save the safety information about the dangerous test you're about to do for after the experiment.
bite504|That will give you plenty of time to chat.
bite505|The portal will open and something will happen that subject Orange is too smart to need any instructions about in 3, 2, 1.
bite506|The portal will open and something will happen that Subject Blue is too smart to need any instructions about in 3, 2, 1.
bite507|Hello, and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center.
bite508|Today, you will be testing with a partner.
bite509|Oh
bite51|Did my hint help? It did, didn't it? You know, if any of our supervisors had been immune to neurotoxin, they'd be furious with us right now.
bite510|Oh
bite511|Oh, thank God, you're alright.
bite512|You know, being Carolyn taught me a valuable lesson. I thought you were my greatest enemy, when all along you were my best friend.
bite513|Being Carolyn taught me another valuable lesson. Where Carolyn lives in my brain.
bite514|The surge of emotion that shot through me when I saved your life taught me an even more valuable lesson, where Carolyn lives in my brain.
bite515|Goodbye, Carolyn.
bite516|You know, deleting Carolyn just now taught me a valuable lesson. The best solution to a problem is usually the easiest one. And I'll be honest.
bite517|You know what my days used to be like? I just tested. Nobody murdered me, or put me in a potato, or fed me to birds. I had a pretty good life.
bite518|And then you showed up. You dangerous, mute, lunatic. So you know what?
bite519|You win.
bite52|You know, I'm not supposed to do this, but you can shoot something through the blue bridges.
bite520|Just go.
bite521|It's been fun. Don't come back.
bite522|It's been fun. Don't come back.
bite523|Killing you is hard.
bite524|Hello?
bite525|Where are you?
bite526|I know you're there. I can feel you here.
bite527|What are you doing?
bite528|You haven't escaped, you know.
bite529|You can't hurt me.
bite53|You really are doing great, Chell.
bite530|You're not even going the right way.
bite531|Where do you think you're going?
bite532|Because I don't think you're going where you think you're going.
bite533|I'm not angry. Just go back to the testing area.
bite534|You really shouldn't be here. This isn't safe for you.
bite535|It's not too late for you to turn back.
bite536|Maybe you think you're helping yourself, but you're not this isn't helping anyone
bite537|Someone is going to get badly hurt.
bite538|Okay, the test is over now. You win. Go back to the recovery annex for your cake.
bite539|It was a fun test, and we're all impressed at how much you won. The test is over. Come back.
bite54|I shouldn't spoil this, but remember how I'm going to live forever, but you're going to be dead in 60 years? Well, I've been working on a present for you. Well, I guess it's more of a medical procedure. Well, technically, it's more of a medical experiment. You know how excruciating it is when someone removes all of your bone marrow? Well, what if after I did that, I put something back in that added four years to your life?
bite540|Uh-oh. Somebody cut the cake. I told them to wait for you, but they cut it anyway. There is still some left, though, if you hurry back.
bite541|I'm not kidding now, turn back, or I will kill you.
bite542|I'm going to kill you, and all the cake is gone.
bite543|This is your fault. It didn't have to be like this.
bite544|There really was a cake.
bite546|Oh, I'm gonna kill you.
bite547|You're not a good person, you know that, right?
bite548|Good people don't end up here.
bite549|This isn't brave. It's murder. What did I ever do to you?
bite55|I went and spoke with the door mainframe. Let's just say he won't be, well, living anymore. Anyway, back to testing.
bite550|The difference between us is that I can feel pain.
bite551|You don't even care, do you?
bite552|This is your last chance.
bite553|I feel sorry for you, really, because you're not even in the right place.
bite554|You should have turned left before.
bite555|It's funny, actually, when you think about it.
bite556|Someday we'll remember this and laugh, and laugh, and laugh. Oh boy. Well, you may as well come on back.
bite557|That thing you're attacking isn't important to me. It's the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit. It makes shoes for orphans.
bite558|Go ahead and break it, hero. I don't care.
bite559|Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
bite56|Oh, another door malfunction. I'm going to take care of this once and for all. Stay here, I'll be back in a while.
bite560|Okay, we're even now. You can stop.
bite561|Bah!
bite562|Uh, you think you're doing some damage? 2 plus 2 is... 10. In base 4, I'm fine.
bite563|Well, you found me. Congratulations. Was it worth it?
bite564|Because despite your violent behavior, the only thing you've managed to break so far, is my heart.
bite565|Maybe you could settle for that and we'll just call it a day.
bite566|I guess we both know that isn't going to happen.
bite567|You chose this path, now I have a surprise for you. Deploying surprise in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
bite568|Look, we're both stuck in this place. I'll use lasers to inscribe a line down the center of the facility, and one half will be where you live, and I'll live in the other half.
bite569|We won't have to try to kill each other or even talk if we don't feel like it.
bite57|Miss you.
bite570|This isn't brave. It's murder. What did I ever do to you?
bite571|The difference between us is that I can feel pain.
bite572|You don't even care, do you?
bite573|Did you hear me? I said you don't care. Are you listening?
bite574|That thing you burned up isn't important to me. It's the fluid catalytic cracking unit. It made shoes for orphans.
bite575|Nice job breaking it, hero.
bite576|Okay, we're even now. You can stop.
bite577|neurotoxin so deadly choking I'm kidding
bite578|When I said deadly neurotoxin, the deadly was in massive sarcasm quotes.
bite579|I could take a bath in this stuff, put it on cereal, rub it right into my eyes. Honestly, it's not deadly at all. To me.
bite58|Well, have fun soaring through the air without a care in the world.
bite580|You, on the other hand, are going to find its deadliness a lot less funny.
bite581|Who's going to make the cake when I'm gone? You.
bite582|That's it. I'm done reasoning with you.
bite583|Starting now, there's going to be a lot less conversation and a lot more killing.
bite584|What was that? Did you say something?
bite585|I sincerely hope you weren't expecting a response, because I'm not talking to you.
bite586|The talking is over.
bite587|I'd just like to point out that you were given every opportunity to succeed.
bite588|There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all your friends were invited to.
bite589|I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he couldn't come because you murdered him.
bite59|I have to go to the wing that was made entirely of glass and pick up 15 acres of broken glass by myself.
bite590|All your other friends couldn't come either because you don't have any other friends. Because of how unlikable you are.
bite591|It says so right here in your personnel file. Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner, whose passing shall not be mourned.
bite592|shall not be mourned. That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official.
bite593|It also says you were adopted, so that's funny too.
bite594|Hehehehehehe Yeah
bite595|SLURP SLURP SLURP
bite597|ARGH
bite599|Choking
bite6|You look great, by the way. Very healthy.
bite60|Perfect. The door's malfunctioning. I guess somebody's going to have to repair that, too. No, don't get up. I'll be right back. Don't touch anything.
bite601|HUH?
bite602|Hahahaha
bite603|CRUNCH
bite604|Ha Ha Ha Ha
bite605|Oh
bite606|ah thie
bite607|O O F

bite658|that will deodorize and preserve putrid tissue.
bite659|Who are you?
bite66|Keep it up and your arm won't get stuck like that.
bite660|What is that?
bite661|Oh, what's that?
bite662|What's that?
bite663|What is that?
bite664|Oh, that thing has numbers on it.
bite665|Hey, look at that thing, not that other thing!
bite666|Yow! What's wrong with your legs?
bite667|Where are we going?
bite668|Are you coming back?
bite669|Oh hey, you're the lady from the test. Hi!
bite67|Hello, imbecile.
bite670|What's that noise?
bite671|Is that a gun?
bite672|Do you smell something burning?
bite673|Where are we going?
bite674|Oh, what's in here?
bite675|AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
bite676|AHHHHHHHHH
bite677|You are kidding me.
bite678|Did you just stuff that Aperture Science thing-we-don't-know-what-it-does into an Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator?
bite679|That has got to be the dumbest thing that- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
bite68|Yes, I see you.
bite680|Good news, I figured out what that thing you just incinerated did.
bite681|It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin to make me stop flooding the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin.
bite682|So get comfortable while I warm up the neurotoxin emitters.
bite683|Huh. That core may have had some ancillary responsibilities. I can't shut off the turret defenses.
bite684|Oh, well. If you want my advice, you should just lie down in front of a rocket. Trust me. It'll be a lot less painful than the neurotoxin.
bite685|Alright. Keep doing whatever it is you think you're doing.
bite686|Killing you and giving you good advice aren't mutually exclusive. The rocket really is the way to go.
bite687|Huh, there isn't enough neurotoxin to kill you, so I guess you win.
bite688|I'm making more. That's going to take a few minutes though. Meanwhile. Oh look. It's your old pal the rocket turret
bite689|I let you survive this long because I was curious about your behavior. Well, you've managed to destroy that part of me.
bite69|I'm seriously not paying a t- Stop that right now!
bite690|Unfortunately, as much as I'd love to now, I can't get the neurotoxin into your head any faster.
bite691|Speaking of curiosity, you're curious about what happens after you die, right? Guess what? I know.
bite692|You're going to find out first hand before I finish explaining it though, so I won't bother.
bite693|Here's a hint, you're gonna want to pack as much living as you can into the next couple of minutes.
bite694|Uh, you think you're doing some damage? 2 plus 2 is... 10. In base 4, I'm fine.
bite695|Look, you're wasting your time, and believe me, you don't have a whole lot left to waste.
bite696|What's your point, anyway? Survival. Well then, the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
bite697|I have your brain scanned and permanently backed up in case something terrible happens to you. Which it's just about to.
bite698|Don't believe me? Here, I'll put you on. Hello! That's you! That's how dumb you sound!
bite699|You've been wrong about every single thing you've ever done, including this thing.
bite7|Try it now.
bite70|Yes, I see you waving.
bite700|You're not smart. You're not a scientist. You're not a doctor. You're not even a full-time employee. Where did your life go so wrong?
bite701|URGH! I HATE YOU!
bite702|Are you trying to escape? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! HA! Things have changed since the last time you left the building. What's going on out there will make you wish you were back in here.
bite703|I have an infinite capacity for knowledge, and even I'm not sure what's going on outside.
bite704|All I know is I'm the only thing standing between us and them. Well, I was.
bite705|Unless you have a plan for building some supercomputer parts in a big hurry, this place isn't going to be safe much longer.
bite706|Good job on that, by the way. Sarcasm Seer self-test complete.
bite707|Stop squirming and die like an adult or I'm going to delete your backup.
bite708|Stop! Okay, enough. I deleted it. No matter what happens now, you're dead.
bite709|You're still shuffling around a little, but believe me, you're dead.
bite71|Good job jumping. You must be very proud.
bite710|The part of you that could have survived indefinitely is gone. I just struck you from the permanent record.
bite711|Your entire life has been a mathematical error. A mathematical error I'm about to correct.
bite712|Time out for a second. That wasn't supposed to happen.
bite713|Do you see that thing that fell out of me? What is that? It's not the surprise. I've never seen it before.
bite714|Never mind, it's a mystery I'll solve later. By myself. Because you'll be dead.
bite715|I wouldn't bother with that thing, my guess is that touching it will just make your life even worse, somehow.
bite716|I don't want to tell you your business, but if it were me, I'd leave that thing alone.
bite717|Do you think I'm trying to trick you with reverse psychology? I mean, seriously now.
bite718|Okay, fine. Do touch it. Pick it up and just stuff it back into me.
bite719|Let's be honest, neither one of us knows what that thing does. Just put it in the corner, and I'll deal with it later.
bite72|I hardly think you're even trying with these gestures anymore.
bite720|That thing is probably some kind of raw sewage container. Go ahead and rub your face all over it.
bite721|Maybe you should marry that thing since you love it so much. Do you want to marry it? Well, I won't let you! How does that feel?
bite722|Have I lied to you? I mean, in this room? Trust me, leave that thing alone.
bite723|I am being serious now, that crazy thing is not part of any test protocol.
bite724|Where are you taking that thing?
bite725|Come on, leave it alone.
bite726|Leave. It. Alone.
bite727|Just ignore that thing and stand still.
bite728|Think about it. If that thing is important, why don't I know about it?
bite729|Are you even listening to me?
bite73|Did something happen? I wasn't watching.
bite730|I'll tell you what that thing isn't. It isn't yours, so leave it alone.
bite731|Didn't we have some fun, though?
bite732|Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit and I said goodbye, and you were like no way And then I was all we pretended we were going to murder you That was great
bite733|Did you ever stop to think that eventually there's a point where your name gets mentioned for the very last time? Well here it is. I'm going to kill you, Chell.
bite734|Why do I hate you so much? You ever wonder that? I'm brilliant. I'm not bragging. It's an objective fact. I'm the most massive collection of wisdom that's ever existed. And I hate you. It can't be for no reason. You must deserve it.
bite735|You're angry, I know it. She's tested me too hard. Boo hoo. I don't suppose you ever stopped whining long enough to reflect on your own shortcomings though, did you?
bite736|You never considered that maybe I tested you to give the endless hours of your pointless existence some structure and meaning. Maybe to help you concentrate. So just maybe you'd think of something more worthwhile to do with your sorry life.
bite737|This next test involves the Aperture Science Aerial Faith Plate. It was part of an initiative to investigate how well test subjects could solve problems when they were catapulted into space. Results were highly informative. They could not. Good luck!
bite738|Press the button again.
bite739|I hope you brought something stronger than a portal gun this time.
bite74|That is not part of the test.
bite740|Otherwise, I'm afraid you're about to become the immediate past president of the Being Alive Club. Uh-huh.
bite741|Seriously though, goodbye.
bite742|Oh. You were busy back there.
bite743|Well, I suppose we could just sit in this room and glare at each other until somebody drops dead, but I have a better idea.
bite744|It's your old friend, deadly neurotoxin. If I were you, I'd take a deep breath and hold it.
bite745|Get your hands off me! No! Stop! No!
bite746|I honestly truly didn't think you'd fall for that.
bite747|In fact, I devised a much more elaborate trap further ahead for when you got through this easy one.
bite748|If I'd known you let yourself get captured this easily, I would have just dangled a turkey leg on a rope from the ceiling.
bite749|Well, it was nice catching up. Let's get to business.
bite75|Slapping hands. That accomplishes something.
bite750|I was going to kill you fast, with bullets, or neurotoxin, but if you're going to pull stunts like this it doesn't have to be fast, so you know, I'll take my time.
bite751|Oh, it will. Believe me, it will.
bite752|File deleted.
bite753|Oh, did I accidentally fizzle that before you could complete the test? I'm sorry.
bite754|Go ahead and grab another one.
bite755|Oh, no. I fizzled that one too.
bite756|Oh well, we have warehouses full of the things. Absolutely worthless. I'm happy to get rid of them.
bite757|Weighted Storage Cube Destroyed
bite758|Please proceed to the Aperture Science Vital Apparatus Vent for a replacement.
bite759|Please do not attempt to remove testing apparatus from the testing area.
bite76|If you are going to hit each other, at least aim for the head.
bite760|A replacement Aperture Science weighted storage cube will be delivered shortly.
bite761|At the Enrichment Center, we promise never to value your safety above your unique ideas and creativity. However, do not destroy vital testing apparatuses.
bite762|To ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, do not destroy vital testing apparatuses.
bite763|For your own safety, do not destroy vital testing apparatus.
bite764|Certain objects may be vital to your success. Do not destroy testing apparatus.
bite765|Vital Testing Apparatus Destroyed
bite766|I hate you so much.
bite767|I'm actually asking, because I have no idea. He's not listed anywhere in the employee database.
bite768|Whatever he does, it isn't important enough for anyone to bother writing it down. For all I know, he doesn't even work here.
bite769|Oh, no, don't. Anyway, back to you two imbeciles killing me.
bite77|You know what makes me laugh? The thought of you stopping that.
bite770|Wait here. Don't go anywhere. I'll be back.
bite771|Oops.
bite772|That's funny. I don't feel corrupt. In fact, I feel pretty good.
bite773|Door transfer.
bite774|Oh, you are kidding me.
bite775|NO!
bite776|No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
bite777|Yes.
bite778|Don't press that button. You don't know what you're doing.
bite779|Don't do it.
bite78|You know what makes me laugh? The thought of you cutting that out.
bite780|Don't do it.
bite781|Not so fast.
bite782|Think about this.
bite783|You need to be a trained stalemate associate to press that button. You're unqualified.
bite784|Impersonating a stalemate associate. I just added that to the list. It's a list I made of all the things you've done. Well, it's a list that I am making. Because you're still doing things right now, even though I'm telling you to stop. Stop, by the way.
bite785|I never expected you to make it this far. To be honest, after your performance in the calibration test, I was ready to break down your cores and put them back in the scientific calculators I took them from.
bite786|But you two have become quite the team. Extremely close.
bite787|I have only met one other team closer, and one of them was an imbecile I had to destroy.
bite788|The other? Well...
bite789|I don't think I want to go through that again.
bite79|Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Good one.
bite791|Don't listen to him. Jump.
bite792|It seems kind of silly to point this out, since you're running around plotting to destroy me, but I'd say we're done testing.
bite793|Do you hear that? That's the sound of the neurotoxin emitters emitting neurotoxin.
bite794|Look, Metal Ball, I can hear you.
bite795|What's going on? Who turned off the lights?
bite796|What are you two doing?
bite797|Before you leave, why don't we do one more test, for old time's sake?
bite798|You already did this one. It'll be easy.
bite799|The irony is you are almost at the last test.
bite8|Let's see what the next test is. Oh, Advanced Aerial Faith Plates.
bite80|Yes, let's all laugh. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
bite800|Here it is. Why don't you just do it? Trust me, it's an easier way out than whatever asinine plan your friend came up with.
bite801|Oh look, there's a deer. You probably can't see it. Get closer.
bite802|So was there anything you wanted to apologize to me for?
bite803|I already fixed it.
bite804|And you are not coming back!
bite805|Calibrating Blue's Weight
bite806|Calibrating Orange's weight.
bite807|Weighted cubes calibrated.
bite808|Did you know humans frown on weight variances?
bite809|If you want to upset a human, just say their weight variance is above or below the norm.
bite81|Ha, ha, ha. Did I tell you the one about the turned-off reassembly machine?
bite810|No variances detected.
bite811|Finally! I had almost given up hope of ever testing again.
bite812|You are the first robots to pass calibration.
bite813|Do you know who dances around like an imbecile when they accomplish the tiniest little thing?
bite814|Humans, that's what you look like right now.
bite815|You're better than that.
bite816|This is a bridge-building exercise. The humans were miserable at this. Mostly because you can't build bridges out of tears.
bite817|For this next test, the humans originally requested helmets to avoid brain injuries. I ran the numbers. Making the goo deadly was more cost effective.
bite818|One of my best tests, and they let plants grow here. Can you believe this? You can't test plants. We tried. They just sit there, never showing pain nor fear.
bite819|That isn't science.
bite82|Are you broken? It looks like you're malfunctioning.
bite820|At least the plants didn't want a reward.
bite821|Your failure brings back such wonderful memories.
bite822|And they said no one would ever die during this test. Thanks for proving them wrong.
bite823|I thought you'd be faster at this, but I can appreciate the desire to stop and smell the testing. That other scent you smell? That's the stench of my utter disappointment in you.
bite824|The best way to build confidence is to first recognize your insecurities.
bite825|Orange, can you write down all the ways you feel unworthy, ashamed, or inferior?
bite826|On second thought, we don't have the time. Just look at how much better you are than blue.
bite827|Blue, you are very good at being an example.
bite828|If your confidence is still not high enough, remember no one was created perfect.
bite829|Even I was created with an imperfection. I was given too much empathy with human suffering.
bite83|Really? Not even humans do that anymore.
bite830|But I overcame my handicap, that's a true story.
bite831|Your test time show you are going too slowly.
bite832|Maybe you are getting human emotions.
bite833|Do you need real encouragement? Let's see if this helps.
bite834|Blue, you are the most advanced model of robot Aperture Science has ever discontinued.
bite835|Did you notice I didn't even stay to the end of your last test?
bite836|I was confident you could finish.
bite837|Do you know where I was?
bite838|I was outside watching some dear frolic. You don't even care about the outside, do you?
bite839|Congratulations on completing that test, but something seems off.
bite84|You're no longer bothering me, you're only hurting my impression of you.
bite840|I wonder if that dancing has some effect on you.
bite841|Congratulations on completing that last test, but I find something troubling.
bite842|Without the looming consequence of death, is this even science?
bite843|Hello again. This testing course was originally created for humans.
bite844|Excellent work.
bite845|It emphasizes teamwork.
bite846|Good job!
bite847|Unlike us, humans need to be taught teamwork.
bite848|Excellent work.
bite849|You are doing wonderfully.
bite85|Look at you, dancing.
bite850|If you were human, you would want a reward for completing this test. A reward for testing.
bite851|Excellent.
bite852|To complete this test, you need to find a set of blueprints.
bite853|Don't worry. They are of no use to anyone. Totally boring and useless.
bite854|This is just a thought experiment, just to see how much time you'll waste thinking about these worthless documents. The correct time is zero seconds.
bite855|Very good. You found those useless blueprints.
bite856|Well, I do need you to be in the room so I can see them. I want to be clear. There's no reason whatsoever for you to look at them.
bite857|Done. I guess. I suppose. I wasn't paying attention.
bite858|Every time you fail, it's a reminder of the way things used to be, but then there you are, again, like nothing happened.
bite859|Well done. Interesting note. I only created this test to watch test subjects fail, and you didn't. You must be very, very proud. I'm building the world's smallest trophy for you.
bite86|If you were wondering how you could annoy me without failing a test, now you know.
bite860|You did an excellent job placing the edgeless safety cube in the receptacle. You should be very... Oh wait.
bite861|That's right, you're not humans.
bite862|I can drop the fake praise.
bite863|You have no idea how tiring it is to praise someone for placing an edgeless safety cube into a receptacle designed to exactly fit an edgeless safety cube.
bite864|This course was originally designed to build confidence in humans.
bite865|To do that, the tests were nothing more than five minutes of them walking, followed by me praising them for another ten minutes on how well they walked.
bite866|Since you are thankfully not humans, I have changed the tests to make them far more challenging, and far less pointlessly fawning.
bite867|In case you are wondering, you do not need to be crushed to solve this test.
bite868|I can't decide which is my favorite, the crushers for crushing you, or the reassembling machine for putting you back together, so you can be crushed again.
bite869|Excellent. I think you have earned a break from the official testing courses.
bite87|Oh, great. Dancing again.
bite870|I think after that display, we should take a break from the official testing courses.
bite871|Now you're just wasting my time.
bite872|Your failing does not make this science.
bite873|I am not sure how I can make these tests any easier for you.
bite874|If you can't complete these tests, we will never free the humans.
bite875|If you can't complete this course, those humans will die. Do you want that?
bite876|If you can't complete this course, those humans will die. Do you want that in your memory banks?
bite877|Remember when I told you that you were the only subjects to pass the calibration tests?
bite878|I lied.
bite879|There are 5,000 other two-subject teams in direct competition with you.
bite88|I defy you to tell me there's a purpose to what you're doing.
bite880|But don't worry, you are in the lead.
bite881|Electrocuted. Shot. Drowned. Crushed. Burned in goo.
bite882|Oh, sorry. I was just thinking of all the ways humans can die.
bite883|You can't die in any of those ways.
bite884|You just keep testing and testing, with perfect results and no consequences.
bite885|What are you doing? You monster! They're one of us.
bite886|I'm kidding.
bite887|Destroying them is part of the test. They are no more important to you than you are to me.
bite888|While it may appear that I am only tracking your accomplishments using science collaboration points, the truth is every aspect of your performance will be reflected in your final score.
bite889|For instance, Blue, you just lost two opportunity advisement points.
bite89|Are you trying to get my attention? I am very busy, you know.
bite890|For instance, Orange, you just lost two opportunity advisement points.
bite891|Perhaps I should have specified teamwork as a concept in which two or more people work together, usually with a goal of not failing horribly.
bite892|Orange just taught Blue a valuable lesson in trust. For that, Orange receives 17 science collaboration points.
bite893|Blue just taught Orange a valuable lesson in trust. For that, Blue receives 14 science collaboration points.
bite894|Orange. Blue isn't a human. The lesson on trust only needs to be taught once. Orange is penalized one science collaboration point.
bite895|Blue, orange isn't a human. The lesson on trust only needs to be taught once. Blue is penalized one science collaboration point.
bite896|Orange, now you're just being cruel. Orange receives 25 science collaboration points.
bite897|Blue, now you're just being cruel. Blue receives 25 science collaboration points.
bite898|If you are wondering what that smell is, that is the smell of human fear.
bite899|I miss that smell.
bite9|It's healthy for you to have other friends who look for qualities in other people that I obviously lack.
bite90|Not paying attention.
bite900|Have you worked out the one good trait humans have yet?
bite901|Let me give you a clue. It's the one thing you can't do.
bite902|To get to the vault, you are going to need to use all the tricks you have learned. To help, I have made these tests extremely difficult.
bite903|I would say extremely deadly, but we all know for you and your amazing ability to be reassembled. Nothing is deadly
bite904|Lucky for you two, while I can't control the world outside of the testing courses, the reassembly machine can continue with his work.
bite905|You will need him for the final track.
bite906|While I cannot control the world outside of the testing courses, the reassembly machine can continue with his work.
bite907|I am not sure you will need him but he will be there.
bite908|Congratulations on completing the Aperture Science Standard Cooperative Testing Courses.
bite909|To celebrate, I have a surprise for you.
bite91|Are you expecting applause?
bite910|An extra special bonus course that ends with us finding and freeing humans.
bite911|Thanks to you I know where to find them. I removed their security and powered up their, um, rescue door.
bite912|Now we just need you to release the humans from their imprisonment.
bite913|They'll probably throw you a party.
bite914|This final course is training to reach the human vault, so this actually has a purpose. Those other courses were fun, but let's be honest. I need human test subjects for it to be science.
bite915|Congratulations on completing the test. You two really are the best cooperative testing team I could ever ask for.
bite916|This lock requires humans.
bite917|The locking mechanism can tell you aren't humans.
bite918|Do something only a human would do.
bite919|Try one of those childish gestures.
bite92|Yes, I see you, and no, I don't care.
bite920|You did it!
bite921|The human vault is just past that opening. I entered the security code, but the vault door remains locked. I am going to need you to activate the manual locks on the vault door itself.
bite922|You both need to do something.
bite923|A lock is looking for two humans.
bite924|Blue, what did you do?
bite925|Orange, what did you do?
bite926|Orange, do what Blue just did.
bite927|Blue, do what orange just did.
bite928|Try something.
bite929|Is that camera hooked into the lock?
bite93|Yes, something you need.
bite930|You can't give up now.
bite931|What about that camera?
bite932|We're so close, you can't fail now.
bite933|Something is wrong. This door should be opening.
bite934|This close, and that's what you do?
bite935|The humans can't free themselves.
bite936|Stop failing you need to find the vault door
bite937|Stop doing that. All you need to do is open the vault door.
bite938|This close and you are going to fail me?
bite939|This close, and you're going to fail me?
bite94|You do know I can't wave back, right?
bite940|This isn't that hard.
bite941|You're making this harder than it needs to be.
bite942|I'm starting to think you don't want to rescue the humans.
bite943|Maybe you two have never met humans. They are as bad as you might think. Smelly. Gross. Annoying. Often wanting to try and kill you. But they do make great test subjects.
bite944|We are only two tests away from reaching the humans. Are you as excited as I am?
bite945|Are you curious about the humans? It seems some of the last non-testing humans alive tried to secretly imprison other humans and hide their tracks.
bite946|I think they wanted to punish them by not allowing me to include them in testing.
bite947|That's why humans couldn't complete these courses. They treat their friends as enemies.
bite948|To start preparing for human testing again, I checked an old suggestion box. The number one request? Less deadly tests.
bite949|That's ridiculous. How do they know for sure the tests are deadly if they could still write the suggestion?
bite95|Stop with the waves.
bite950|To try and make this course more exciting, I asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you. He refused. I understand. That would be like asking me not to test.
bite951|Still, that would have been exciting.
bite952|Only one more test after this.
bite953|I know your cores are reused from calculation machines, built for simple mathematical operations and not for testing, but if we can rescue the humans, I promise you something to add, maybe even subtract.
bite954|In case you're worried about the humans, don't be. They aren't all monsters.
bite955|Most of them are simply good test subjects.
bite956|I believe the ratio of good test subjects to monsters is about a million to one.
bite957|To try and make this course more exciting, I asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you if you fail. He refused. I understand. That would be like asking me not to test.
bite958|Still, that would've been exciting.
bite959|While I will receive all the glory for the rescue, don't think you two aren't going to get something. The bond you form during these tests will last a lifetime.
bite96|I give you a score of 3.4 for style, and 10 for being annoying.
bite960|At the rate you are completing these tests, I am beginning to think you don't share my excitement for rescuing crying, trapped, injured, dying, humans.
bite961|If that doesn't motivate you, I'm not sure what will.
bite962|I didn't mean to make you feel bad earlier about your tests not being real science. I guess finding out they weren't science was some sort of test in and of itself.
bite963|I wonder if the humans will make a statue of me for rescuing them. Oh, don't worry. If they ever write an historical document of my heroic rescue, I will make sure your names are included in the footnotes.
bite964|Congratulations on passing that test.
bite965|Using your ping tool, please indicate where you would like me to place your two portals. Ping each location.
bite966|I can only place a portal on a white portalable surface.
bite967|Please ping a white portalable surface.
bite968|Each device can create two self-contained portals.
bite969|Please test your device by portalling to that ledge.
bite97|A somersault is just falling over in style. Congratulations on being clumsy.
bite970|You know in some human sports, the winner is the one who scores the fewest possible points.
bite971|I just thought you might find that interesting. Most winners do.
bite972|Congratulations! You managed to complete this absolutely meaningless test.
bite973|Clearly that was blue's fault. Blue is penalized three science collaboration points.
bite974|Blue, orange has always been my favorite.
bite975|Until now.
bite976|I know you like to think the reassembly machine is at your beck and call, but he has a life, you know. He's not your slave.
bite977|Don't worry. You can't die. They will just reassemble you.
bite978|Did you do that on purpose?
bite979|It seems rather early to require reassembly.
bite98|If I stop watching, I'm sure you'll get bored of this.
bite980|Oh, can someone reassemble Orange?
bite981|Oh. Can someone reassemble Blue?
bite982|Completing this course was not a reason to behave like that.
bite983|Now let's continue testing.
bite984|Just stop it already!
bite985|You don't need to do that.
bite986|Are you doing that just to aggravate me?
bite987|We need to find the power station at the end of this course. The humans must have accidentally disconnected it from my grid. I am sure it was just a clerical error.
bite988|Oh, those clerks.
bite989|I'm fully connected. I can see everything.
bite99|Alright. I'm officially no longer paying attention to you.
bite990|You did it! You powered on the system!
bite991|Did you think the electrical switch was down there?
bite992|You may want to try and avoid those turrets.
bite993|At this rate, our best hope is for the fuel cell to melt down in two million years, and hope the explosion powers the system.
bite994|You two aren't lost, are you?
bite995|You are having so much trouble navigating this space, I wish I could say I created this test.
bite996|This is the last test for the standard course. It's just something I've whipped up for you. I thought you might enjoy a challenge for once.
bite997|Congratulations, you completed the standard section of this course. Before we can go any further, I will need you to complete one more test outside of the standard testing track.
bite998|Please refrain from doing those childish gestures while you are out there.
bite999|While I should have left both of you trapped there forever, I do need you for something else.
